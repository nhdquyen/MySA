Acetyl Hexapeptide-1;Best;Peptides, Humectant;Anti-Aging, Hydration;Acetyl hexapeptide-1 is a synthetic peptide composed of the amino acids alanine, arginine, histidine, leucine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. It helps skin better defend itself from environmental aggressors by virtue of a calming effect. This peptide can also help promote a visibly more even skin tone by playing a role in how melanin moves through skin.
Acetyl Hexapeptide-37;Best;Peptides, Humectant;Anti-Aging, Hydration;Acetyl hexapeptide-37 is a synthetic peptide composed of the amino acids alanine, proline, serine and glycine. This peptide works with the water channels (known as aquaporins) in skin's surface layers, helping to provide adequate, balanced hydration between skin's layers, a process which alleviates signs of dry, dehydrated skin. Although there isn't independent research confirming the effectiveness of this peptide on skin, the supplier (Lipotec) has made the results of their research available in a lengthy Technical Report that's supported by third-party studies. Between this information and the wider field of published scientific research on peptides for skin, we feel confident recommending this peptide, particularly for dehydrated skin.
Acetyl Hexapeptide-8;Good;Peptides, Humectant;Anti-Aging, Hydration;On the other hand, research has shown this peptide can penetrate further into skin if specific formulary steps are followed, including the type of emulsion (a higher water content showed greater penetration). As always, this demonstrates the importance of selecting well-formulated skin care products to add to your routine.
Acetyl Octapeptide-3;Good;Peptides;Anti-Aging, Hydration;Synthetic peptide that is based around octapeptide-3, a peptide complex composed of the amino acids aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, and methionine. Also known as SNAP-8, this peptide is said to improve the look of signs of aging formed from repetitive facial expressions, though there’s no independent research supporting this claim. Even if there were independent research, the concentrations used in the company-sponsored testing to support the improvement of signs of aging was 3-10%, which is far greater than what’s typically present in skin care products. Like all peptides it has water-binding properties and theoretical skin-restoring ability. It may play a role in helping skin look younger, and can help hydrate and smooth skin.
Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging, Hydration;A synthetic peptide created by the acetylation (a chemical reaction that joins a stronger substance with a weaker one) of tetrapeptide-11, which is made up of amino acids leucine, proline and tyrosine. Acetyl tetrapeptide-11 helps skin become healthier by interacting with a signaling protein in skin’s surface that addresses how it looks and feels.
Acetyl Tetrapeptide-5;Best;Peptides, Humectant;Anti-Aging, Soothing;A synthetic peptide that has calming, smoothing, hydrating, and firmness-enhancing benefits when applied to skin. Its calming properties are believed to reduce undereye puffiness due to fluid accumulation, such as from allergies (which is not the same as undereye bags that occur from fat pads beneath the skin slipping out of place).This peptide is also believed to interrupt a process in skin known as glycation, which can cause skin's supportive elements to weaken, giving way to wrinkles and loss of firmness. Acetyl tetrapeptide-5 seems to step in and help skin maintain a smooth resilience that results in a more youthful look.
Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9;Best;Peptides, Humectant;Anti-Aging;A synthetic peptide created by the acetylation (a chemical reaction that joins a stronger substance with a weaker one) of tetrapeptide-9, which is composed of the amino acids aspartic acid, glutamine, histidine and valine.Acetyl tetrapeptide-9 helps visibly restore skin's natural support, including a specialized protein known as lumican, which helps keep skin smooth and taut.

Advanced Glycation Endproduct (AGE);Worst;Irritant;;"Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are destructive substances generated in the body when we consume refined sugars and due to environmental exposure without adequate protection. But first, a bit of back story...
One of the more depressing skin care facts we can think of is how bad dietary sugar or high glycemic index foods (foods that turn to sugar almost immediately after eating them) are for almost every aspect of your skin. Chocolate cake, honey-drenched sweets, ice cream sundaes, bread pudding, and on and on (and we could go on and on) cause very bad things to happen to skin. UV light and air pollutants are attacking your skin from the outside in, and sugar is attacking it from the inside out.
What’s the relationship between sugar and AGEs? Sugars quickly and strongly bind to proteins in the skin (proteins are the main building blocks of skin) forming AGEs that progressively and continually destroy many aspects of skin, especially elastin and collagen, the two substances that give skin its firmness and resilience. Once generated, AGEs begin a cascade of progressive damage that isn’t easy to stop or reverse.
Research has also shown AGEs can cause abnormal melanin production that leads to the formation of brown spots and mottled skin discolorations. Another ironic acronym for this is RAGEs, meaning a receptor site for AGEs that induces unhealthy melanin production.
Although sugar is certainly a major culprit in the skin-damaging creation of AGEs, so is something called the Maillard Reaction (MR). The Maillard Reaction is what happens when you cook any food and brown or blacken it with high heat. That means steaming or sautéeing food without browning is far healthier for your skin and body. And chargrilling foods, especially meats, at high heat is even worse! Our apologies to those who prefer their steaks well done.
While some skin care companies claim their products contain ingredients that can block AGEs from forming, that benefit hasn’t been supported anywhere in the research. In the meantime, while science is working on this insidious problem, eating a low sugar diet that’s rich in antioxidants, complex carbohydrates, and omega fatty acids is by far the best approach for younger-looking, healthy skin from the inside out (and when you put those ingredients on your skin it can help from the outside in too, it’s just not clear how much that helps control the visible effects of AGEs; however, a huge amount of research shows those ingredients to be beneficial for skin overall).
What about the occasional sweet treat? Although we can’t change what eating refined sugars does to your skin (and yes, this includes so-called sugar substitutes like raw honey and agave nectar, both of which the body recognizes as simple sugars), we also realize that sweets play a role in the pleasures of eating and celebrating. The trick is to keep it in moderation, meaning an occasional, judicious indulgence rather than daily consumption of desserts, sugary sodas, and flavored coffee drinks, the latter of which can contain an alarming amount of sugars."

Alumina;Average;Absorbent, Texture Enhancer;Oil Control;Naturally occurring mineral used as an abrasive, a thickening agent, and an absorbent in cosmetics.
Aluminum;Good;;;"Aluminum is the most common element on Earth. It’s also a common source of confusion in terms of its presence in cosmetics, specifically whether that presence poses a health risk. The fact is, when you read “aluminum” on an ingredient list, it isn’t pure aluminum— not even close.
Pure aluminum is not added to any skincare or makeup product. Rather, compounds (mixtures of aluminum), such as aluminum combined with other natural elements, are safety used in a variety of ways in personal care products, foods and medicines. These compounds contain only traces of aluminum, and in daily use over the long term are perfectly safe. Such ingredients actually contain less aluminum than what occurs naturally in plants, vegetables or even in the human body).
Here are a few examples of the most common aluminum compounds used as ingredients in cosmetics, and a brief description of what they are (as well as their global safety status).
1. Aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride contain only trace quantities of pure aluminum. These are most commonly used in antiperspirant and deodorants (and some medications) with extensive safety records.
2. Alumina is also not “aluminum,” but rather a combination of minerals that contain various mixtures of aluminum, silica, chloride or zirconium and oxygen. It is also known as “aluminum oxide” or “aluminum hydroxide,” and is used safely in cosmetics, medicines and medical devices.
3. Magnesium aluminum silicate is refined from clay and often used as an absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It is unable to penetrate skin.
4. Aluminum starch is made from a reaction of a plant-derived ingredient (starch), and often used as a thickening or absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It has an extensive safety record.
In cosmetics, the minute quantities of aluminum present in such ingredients are not at risk of absorption, as it these ingredients are insoluble—they are physically incapable of absorption into the body. This is true of such ingredients, whether they are used in cosmetics or skincare/personal care products.
In fact, skin does not readily absorb cosmetic ingredients. It’s actually quite challenging to penetrate the skin’s outer layers with skincare or medical products- such formulas must be specifically engineered to allow ingredients to penetrate even the most superficial layer of skin.
Thus, aluminum or aluminum ingredients do not contribute to health risks, and a link otherwise has not been established. Quite the opposite, as the Mayo Clinic, The World Health Organization, the European Union and the FDA have all concurred that there is no linkage of aluminum in personal care products to other health risks.
Published literature and an overwhelming amount of research has shown that skin cannot absorb aluminum from these ingredients, and what is used is far less than what we are exposed to daily in the food and water (given aluminum is a natural element that’s present all around us—whether we use products with aluminum ingredients or not)."

Amino Acids;Best;Antioxidant, Humectant;Hydration;"Amino acids are the fundamental constituents of all proteins found in the body, such as: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, cystine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine.
Some of these amino acids can be synthesized by the body; others (known as essential amino acids) must be obtained from protein in the diet. In skin care products, amino acids act as water-binding agents, and some have antioxidant properties. Amino acids can be combined with other ingredients that have skin-restorative ability to work in unison to fight signs of aging.
Note: Research has shown amino acids for skin work best when several of them are combined. For this reason, we rate the amino acids as a group more highly than some individual amino acids. Although some individual amino acids have distinctive benefits compared to others, you would be selling your skin short if you only focused on one particular amino acid."

Argania Spinosa;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;
Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil;Best;Emollient, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Hydration, Anti-Aging;The Latin name for the oil expressed from the kernels of the argan tree.
Argan Oil;Best;Emollient, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Hydration, Anti-Aging;Non-fragrant plant oil expressed from the kernels of argan trees. Argan oil contains several beneficial lipids and fatty acids for skin, including oleic acid, palmitic acid, and, especially, linoleic acid. It is also a good source of antioxidant vitamin E (tocopherol) and, like several other plant oils, a source of other antioxidant compounds.Despite the hype, argan oil isn’t a miraculous ingredient by any stretch of the imagination. It’s merely a good, emollient, non-fragrant plant oil. It’s a consideration if skin or hair is dry to very dry, but is not necessarily any better than many other non-fragrant plant oils used in cosmetics. As with any plant oil, those with oily skin should think twice before applying it full strength as doing so will make skin look and feel greasy.
Arginine;Best;Antioxidant, Humectant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that arginine is safe in the present practices of use and concentration (up to 18%) in cosmetics. It is also known as l-arginine.
Arginine/Lysine Polypeptide;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging, Hydration;In terms of concentration for visible results, the recommended amount to use is between 0.4-2% of this blend.

Argireline;Good;Peptides;Anti-Aging;
Aristotelia Chilensis (Maqui);Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Maqui, also known as Chilean wineberry, is a richly-colored berry that contains a potent type of antioxidant anthocyanidin known as delphinidins, which can help skin better withstand the rigors of UV light exposure (but just to be clear, this ingredient does not replace the need for sunscreen). Maqui is also a great antioxidant when consumed orally, largely due to the action of its polyphenols, flavanols, other anthocyanins, and ellagic acid, all of which work to squelch damaging free radicals that, left unchecked, can lead to health issues.
Arnica Extract;Worst;Plant Extracts, Irritant;;Extract or oil obtained from the flowering plant Arnica montana. There is research showing that when arnica is taken orally before surgery it soothes sensitivity. However, in high amounts it is a risk for skin sensitivity.
Aroma/Flavor;Average;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural;;Seeing “aroma/flavor” on an ingredient list can be either good or bad. For example, if the aroma or flavor comes from mint or citrus, it can be sensitizing. But if the source is something more innocuous, like vanilla, then it shouldn’t pose a risk. According to the Personal Care Product Council’s Ingredient Database, “Aroma is a term for ingredient labeling used to identify that a product contains a material or combination of materials normally added to a cosmetic to produce or to mask a particular flavor.” The point to be aware of is what kind of flavor your lips (or skin) are being exposed to - and whether or not the exposure poses a risk of sensitivity. Last, be aware that highly flavored lip products can encourage lip-licking - after all, such products do tend to taste goodâ€”but they shouldn’t be eaten, and licking your lips too often can cause or worsen dry lips.

It functions as an emollient ingreident that works to keep moisture in skin and soften its texture. More commonly known as murumuru butter, it is a species of Brazilian palm tree and its benefits are considered similar to palm oil. Unlike palm oil, there’s little research proving murumuru butter is great for dry skin, though as with any butter, it can be considered a good emollient.

The Board determined barium sulfate is safe and non-sensitizing provided it’s formulated to be non-irritating (meaning the finished ingredient does not contain irritating salts from sulfuric acid). As the synthetic form of barium sulfate is what’s available for use in cosmetics, there is, quite literally, no need to be concerned that it might irritate skin; however, as with any cosmetic ingredient, an individual allergic reaction could still occur (although this is considered rare)."
Barley Extract;Good;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Extract from barley plants. Can have antioxidant properties when ingested, but there is no research showing this to be the case when applied topically. Barley and its extracts/derivatives are a source of gluten.

It is considered safe as used in cosmetics, including products meant for application to lips. Interestingly, behenic acid is one of the fatty acids that occurs naturally in human sebum (oil), so it's considered bio-compatible with skin. Behenic acid is also one of the saturated main fatty acids found in fish oil.
Bellis Perennis;Worst;Plant Extracts, Irritant, Antioxidant;;

A beta hydroxy acid (BHA) product with salicylic acid exfoliates skin and soothes. It is a multi-benefit ingredient used to improve acne and blackheads. In order for beta hydroxy acid products to function as exfoliants, the pH of the product must be between 3 and 4 (lower pH values are effective, too, but much below pH 3 is very sensitizing to skin).
Betaine;Good;Humectant;Hydration;A gentle hydrating ingredient that may be plant-derived or synthetic, betaine also naturally occurs in skin and the body. It's known as an osmolyte, an ingredient that helps skin adapt to moisture losses and gains, essentially working to balance skin's hydration.
Betaine Salicylate;Good;Exfoliant;Anti-Acne;"Anecdotal information from consumers who’ve tried products with betaine salicylate and salicylic acid is mixed; some people report better results and tolerability with betaine salicylate, while others report that salicylic acid worked better, without any unwanted effects. Our advice? Unless you know your skin cannot tolerate or doesn’t respond well to leave-on exfoliants with salicylic acid, there’s little reason to seek out an exfoliant with betaine salicylate. However, if you live in a country where salicylic acid’s use in skincare is unusually restricted, betaine salicylate exfoliants are worth checking out, but be sure the concentration is at least 4%."
Beta-Sitosterol;Best;Plant Extracts, Emollient;Hydration;A fatty acid-type ingredient derived from plants. Beta-sitosterol occurs naturally in many fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. It is similar to cholesterol, which occurs naturally in skin. Applied to skin, it is considered a good moisturizing and skin-soothing ingredient.

Betula Alba;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;
Betula Alba (Birch) Juice;Good;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration;"The sap (""juice"") from the birch tree known by its Latin name of Betula alba. Unlike maple or most other types of sap, birch juice is clear and doesn't have much flavor, it's just slightly sweet. The juice is a good source of trace minerals like manganese as well as various amino acids, all of which make it a good natural hydrator for skin--but more research is needed before we have a complete understanding of how the various nutrients in birch juice benefit skin (or when the juice is consumed, as birch sap has seemingly replaced coconut water as the new must-have super-drink)."
BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid);Best;Exfoliant;Anti-Acne, Blackhead Reducing, Soothing;BHA is an acronym for beta hydroxy acid, which is more commonly known as salicylic acid, an ingredient that has multiple benefits for numerous skin types and concerns.

Biotin/Folic Acid/Cyanocobalamin/Niacinamide/Pantothenic Acid/Pyridoxine/Riboflavin/Thiamine/Yeast Polypeptides;Best;Antioxidant, Peptides;Anti-Aging, Hydration;"Biotin/folic acid/cyanocobalamin/niacinamide/pantothenic acid/pyridoxine/riboflavin/thiamine/yeast polypeptides is a blend of several B vitamins plus peptides derived from a strain of lab-produced yeast. The B vitamins undergo a chemical reaction with the yeast and proteins (peptides) that is said to boost the stability of the vitamins, allowing them to work better on skin.
This complex conditions and softens skin while also helping to energize surface cells. It’s also purported to enhance penetration of ingredients into skin’s uppermost layers while the peptide portion moisturizes skin. All of the B vitamins in this blend play supporting roles in helping skin recover from damage and regain a healthy appearance."
Birch Bark Extract;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Soothing;Extract derived from the plant Betula alba (common name white birch).

Bismuth Oxychloride;Average;Coloring Agent/Pigment, Absorbent;;Some people react to bismuth oxychloride due to its unique crystalline structure. What happens is that the crystals can “poke” at skin and get stuck in the pores, where the sharper “spokes” can cause irritation. This is more of a problem when bismuth oxychloride is the main ingredient in powder makeup.Pure concentrations of bismuth oxychloride nanoparticles appear to have a negative effect on human skin cells.

Boron Nitride;Good;Absorbent, Texture Enhancer;;Synthetic, inorganic powder, which in cosmetics has absorbent properties similar to those of natural powders such as talc.
Boswellia Carterii;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Boswellia Serrata Extract;Average;Plant Extracts, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Antioxidant;;An extract from the gum resin of a tree and also a source of Indian frankincense, this plant extract has both positive and negative qualities for skin. Its fragrant components have the potential to be sensitizing. On the flipside, Boswellia serrata also has research showing it has an skin-soothing effect. Clearly there’s some benefit for skin, but there are potential risks, too, just like with lots of other fragrant plant extracts.
Botanicals;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural;;General term for a large group of natural ingredients. Botanicals may or may not be organic, and their benefit or risk for your skin depends on the specific botanical in question. Simply put, there are many helpful botanical (natural) ingredients for skin but there are also many that are a must to avoid. Unfortunately, many of the most problematic botanicals routinely show up in skincare products from lines that work overtime to convince you they’re better for you because they only contain natural/botanical ingredients. Shopping for products with botanical/natural ingredients without knowing which ones to avoid is a surefire way to cause needless sensitivity that leads to a host of skin problems.

Cocamide DEA And MEA;Bad;Cleansing Agent, Texture Enhancer;;Both cocamide DEA (diethanolamine) and MEA (monoethanolamine) are widely used to thicken the water phase of cosmetics, keep ingredients blended, and boost foaming properties. Derived from plants (typically coconut oil) or made synthetically, these ingredients have been thoroughly evaluated for safety and are permitted for use in leave-on products in concentrations up to 10%. Cocamide DEA can react with other ingredients to form harmful substances known as nitrosamines. According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Board, “To prevent the formation of possibly [harmful] nitrosamines, these ingredients should not be used in cosmetics and personal care products containing nitrosating agents.” The CIR Expert Panel concluded that “Cocamide DEA was safe as used in rinse-off products and safe at concentrations of less than or equal to 10% in leave-on products.”
Cocamidopropyl Betaine;Good;Cleansing Agent, Texture Enhancer;;Cocamidopropyl betaine is approved for use up to 3% in leave-on products but its concentration range for rinse-off formulas is much wider, typically between 4-40% depending on the formula’s characteristics.
Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine;Good;Cleansing Agent;;An antistatic agent derived from fatty acids found in coconut oil, though it may be produced synthetically, too. Although very high concentrations can be sensitizing, this ingredient is considered safe and effective when used in lower amounts in water-based formulas. Despite its function as an antistatic agent, cocamidopropyl dimethylamine belongs to the same class of ingredients as the cleansing/lather agent cocamidopropyl betaine.

Colloidal Oatmeal;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;A form of oatmeal used in cosmetics and skin care products. It is produced by finely grinding oats, then boiling them. Research shows avenathramides, potent types of antioxidants found in oats (and colloidal oatmeal), can help soothe skin. A high concentration of beta-glucan and starches in colloidal oatmeal also mean it has water-binding properties and is an effective skin protectant. In fact, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) categorizes colloidal oatmeal as a skin protectant, allowing it to be listed as an active ingredient on skin care products.
Colloidal Silver;Worst;Preservative, Irritant;;Refers to ground-up silver suspended in solution.
Comfrey Extract;Worst;Plant Extracts, Irritant;;Extract of a perennial herb that several studies have shown can have harmful properties when taken orally. Topical application of comfrey has skin-soothing properties, but it is recommended only for short-term use and only then if you can be sure the amount of pyrrolizidine alkaloids is less than 100 micrograms per application - something that is impossible to determine without sophisticated testing equipment - making comfrey an ingredient to avoid. The alkaloid content means it has the potential to aggravate skin.

Lauriminodipropionic acid is a propionic acid, a natural acid that is part of the degraded contents of sugar. It has mild preservative properties.
Disodium Rutinyl Disulfate;Good;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone;A water-soluble derivative of the bioflavinoid rutin. Research shows rutin has both antioxidant and skin-soothing properties.
Disteardimonium Hectorite;Good;Suspending/Dispersing Agent;;Used as a suspending agent, often with pigments.
DMAE;Bad;pH Adjuster/Stabilizer;;Moreover, because almost all moisturizers (including serums and eye creams) are formulated with a pH that closely matches that of human skin (generally 5.5-6.5, which is on the acidic side of the scale), in all likelihood the DMAE included in skin care products cannot have any prolonged functionality.
DMDM Hydantoin;Bad;Preservative;;Synthetic, formaldehyde-releasing preservative that has mixed research on its potential to aggravate skin. Despite its connection to formaldehyde, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board has confirmed the safety of this preservative in three separate reviews, each spaced several years apart.
Docosahexaenoic Acid;Best;Emollient, Texture Enhancer;;
Dog Rose;Good;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;

Eclipta Prostrata Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;;An annual plant common to Korea, Eclipta prostrata has potent antioxidant and skin-calming properties. Also known as false daisy, this non-fragrant plant is a member of the sunflower family.
Ectoin;Best;Emollient;Hydration;Ectoin is a synthetic ingredient that serves as an emollient on skin and can also have a buffering effect in cosmetic formulas. Chemically, ectoin is considered an osmolyte. What that means for skin is that as an osmolyte, ectoin helps maintain balanced hydration by maintaining the correct water balance in skin. In doing so, skin can better maintain a smooth, soft surface. Newer research indicates ectoin can also help protect skin from environmental stressors related to different types of natural light and pollutants. This is believed to happen in part because of its antioxidant ability as well as what seems to be a natural ability to protect skin from dehydration due to environmental exposure.
EDTA;Good;Chelating Agent;;EDTA is short for ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, a stabilizer used in cosmetics to prevent ingredients in a given formula from binding with trace elements (particularly minerals) that can be present in water. EDTA also keeps other ingredients from causing unwanted changes to a product’s texture, odor, and/or consistency. Ingredients that perform this function are known as chelating agents. Common examples of EDTA ingredients are disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA. See chelating agent
Egg Yolk;Best;Emollient;Hydration;Egg yolk is mostly water and lipids (fats), especially cholesterol, which makes it a good emollient and replenishing ingredient for skin.
Eicosapentaenoic Acid;Best;Emollient;Hydration;"Fatty acid derived from salmon oil; it is a good emollient and replenishing for skin"
Elaeis Guineensis Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;Elaeis guineensis oil is a soothing source of antioxidants, including vitamin E. As a non-fragrant plant oil, it also has emollient properties for skin.
Elderberry;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Also known as black elderberry or Sambucus nigra, this plant has potent antioxidant properties due to the flavonoid compounds naturally present. Elderberry also has skin-soothing effects.
Elecampane;Worst;Irritant, Plant Extracts;;"Latin name Inula helenium; it is a plant that can be very sensitizing to skin. In cosmetics, this ingredient is most often added for its fragrance. Thisplant can cause allergic reactions for those allergic to plants in the ragweed family."
Ellagic Acid;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Potent antioxidant compound found in pomegranate and most berries.
Emblica Officinalis (Gooseberry) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Also known as amla, the fruit extract from this Indian berry is among the richest plant sources of antioxidants, particularly the phenolic class of antioxidants which include flavonoids like gallic acid, quercetin, and rutin. These and other antioxidant compounds in gooseberry explain its remarkable ability to defend skin from numerous types of damaging free radicals.Along with its antioxidant power, Indian gooseberry has proven to be remarkably soothing, with the ability to quiet factors in skin that stir visible signs of trouble, such as redness and increased sensitivity. This berry has also demonstrated highly impressive antioxidant benefits when consumed via food or supplement, where it can scavenge different types of harmful molecules before they cause harm.
Emollient;Good;Emollient, Texture Enhancer;;Supple, waxlike, lubricating, thickening agent that prevents water loss and has a softening and soothing effect on skin. Examples of emollients are ingredients like plant oils, mineral oil, shea butter, cocoa butter, petrolatum, and fatty acids (animal oils, including emu, mink, and lanolin, the latter probably the one ingredient that is most like our own skin’s oil). More technical-sounding emollient ingredients, such as triglycerides, benzoates, myristates, palmitates, and stearates, are generally waxy in texture and appearance but provide most moisturizers with their elegant texture and feel.
Emulsifier;Good;Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer;;In cosmetics, an emulsifier includes any ingredient that helps keep unlike ingredients (such as oil and water) from separating in an emulsion. Examples of cosmetics ingredients that function as emulsifiers include polysorbates, laureth-4, and potassium cetyl sulfate. Emulsifiers are widely used throughout the cosmetics industry and are the unsung heroes of many cosmetics formulas that blend and help to keep unlike ingredients together. There is also research showing they can help enhance the absorption of skincare ingredients and may be useful for prolonged topical delivery.
Emu Oil;Good;Emollient;Hydration;The emu (_Dromaius novaehollandiae_) is a large, flightless bird indigenous to Australia. The oil contains several fatty acids, including myristic, palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. Emu oil has become an important component of the Australian economy. As a result there is research from that part of the world showing it to be a good emollient that can help restore skin. But along with the evidence that emu oil is a good emollient and the parade of companies promoting it for that, there are also companies promoting products containing emu oil for its antiaging properties. So does emu oil live up to these acclaimed properties? Regrettably, none of these promises are supported by research. A study looked at the “Cosmetic and moisturizing properties of Emu oil... assessed in a double-blind clinical study. Emu oil in comparison to mineral oil was found overall to be more cosmetically acceptable and had better skin penetration/permeability.” Like many ingredients, it has soothing, emollient properties, but it isn’t the miracle marketers make it out to be. Emu oil’s reputation is driven mostly by claims made by companies selling products that contain it, and not by any real proof that it is an essential requirement for skin.
English Ivy Extract;Worst;Plant Extracts, Irritant;;Can be a skin sensitizer due to its astringent properties, especially for those who suffer from allergies or have dry skin conditions. Compared to other allergenic or sensitizing plant extracts, English ivy has a lower risk of causing a reaction.
Ensulizole;Best;UV Filters;;"Also known as phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, ensulizole is a water soluble sunscreen ingredient that works in the UVB range, offering no UVA protection. For this reason, ensulizole should always be paired with one or more UVA-screening sunscreen actives in any SPF-rated product labeled ""broad spectrum"". There's some controversy in the research about what some refer to as ensulizole potentially being a ""double-edged sword"" for skin. Studies on fish scales and bat skin have shown it protects against oxidizing molecules generated by UVB exposure but it can also trigger DNA damage within skin. Although this hasn't shown to be true on human skin, it may at least partially explain why ensulizole is not commonly found in sunscreens, despite having very few reports of triggering allergic reactions on human skin. Aesthetically, ensulizole feels lighter and less oily than most synthetic sunscreen actives, so is sometimes chosen when the goal is a very lightweight texture, although the mineral actives titanium dioxide and zinc oxide can also feel surprisingly light on skin. Ensulizole concentrations up to 4% are approved for use in sunscreens sold in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea. In most other parts of the world, ensulizole concentrations up to 8% are permitted, with the exception of Japan, whose maximum permitted amount is 3%. Along with protecting skin from UVB damage, ensulizole or its salts are sometimes included in cosmetics whose clear packaging would otherwise allow the formula inside to discolor due to ongoing light exposure. Salt forms of ensulizole include potassium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate, sodium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate and TEA-phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate. This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It's important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA's new call for additional testing."
Enteromorpha Compressa Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Texture Enhancer;Anti-Aging;Extract from green algae.
Environmental Damage;Worst;Irritant;;Occurrence that takes place at an atomic level and is a complex physiological process. Molecules are comprised of atoms. Atoms comprise all matter. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons occur in pairs, and when an element only has a few paired electrons it can easily become unstable. Oxygen and oxides are primary examples of potential unstable elements in our environment. When oxygen interacts with skin (and because the air we breathe is 20% oxygen, that happens all the time), it almost always loses one of its electrons. This oxygen molecule, which now is minus one electron, is a damaging environmental factor. Because it is now unstable, the oxygen molecule quickly finds another electron, and it does this by taking an electron from another molecule in the skin, which is usually a healthy substance such as antioxidants in the skin. Antioxidants have lots of electrons to spare. Once those substances are robbed of all their electrons they break down and are destroyed. Oxygen molecules (or other potentially damaging environmental factors) attempting to replenish themselves in this way trigger a cascading event. The reactions that cause environmental damage take place in mere fractions of a second. Antioxidants are substances that prevent oxidative damage from beginning. The primary causes of environmental damage on skin are pollution, air, cigarette smoke, herbicides, and solvents (such as alcohol). Antioxidants are a way to potentially neutralize these effects via topical application.
Enzymes;Good;Exfoliant;Hydration;Vast group of proteins, produced by all living things, that act alone or with other ingredients as catalysts in chemical and biological reactions. Enzymes are divided into six main categories: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases. The names of most, but not all, enzymes end in -ase. Enzymes are used in skincare products to prompt exfoliation. Most enzymes are finicky about how and under what conditions they will act. Sometimes several enzymes are required to carry out a particular reaction, and their actions are affected by temperature and pH. Some enzymes depend on the presence of other enzymes, called coenzymes, to function, or they depend on a specific body temperature. It would require an exceptionally complicated process to stimulate enzyme activity via topical application to skin.
Epigallocatechin Gallate;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Oil Control;One of the active constituents of green tea believed to be responsible for its many health and appearance benefits, both orally and topically. The chief benefit of epigallocatechin-3-gallate is skin-soothing and antioxidant.

Epilobium Fleischeri (Willowherb) Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;Epilobium fleischeri, also known as Alpine willowherb, is a plant extract that has documented skin-calming and antioxidant benefits, largely from its impressive mix of polyphenols. Although some of the information around this plant is more folklore than fact, isolated compounds (chiefly a class of polyphenols known as flavonoids) from this plant have been extensively studied and proven to be helpful when applied to skin.
Equisetum Arvense;Worst;Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Ergocalciferol;Good;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Technical name for vitamin D, also known as vitamin D2.
Ergothioneine;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;A substance derived from animals or various types of mushrooms that has potent antioxidant and skin-soothing properties.
Eriobotrya Japonica;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;
Erythrulose;Good;Coloring Agent/Pigment, Humectant;Hydration;Substance chemically similar to the self-tanning agent dihydroxyacetone. Depending on your skin color, there can be a difference in the color with erythrulose. Erythrulose needs about two to three days for the skin to show a color change, while dihydroxyacetone completely changes the color of skin within two to six hours. For this reason, most products that contain erythrulose also contain dihydroxyacetone.
Esculin;Worst;Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Component of horse chestnut, it is considered a sensitizing and is not recommended for skin, but can have benefits when consmed orally.
Essential Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;
Ester;Good;Emollient;;A compound formed from the reaction between an alcohol and an acid via the elimination of water. Triesters (groups of three esters) form the backbone of many fats, waxes, and oils that have emollient and skin-conditioning properties. Almost all of the esters used in cosmetic products are non-sensitizing and in most cases are quite beneficial for dry skin.
Ester-C;Best;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Trade name for a combination form of vitamin C that contains mainly calcium ascorbate, but in addition contains small amounts of the vitamin C metabolites dehydroascorbic acid (oxidized ascorbic acid), calcium threonate, and trace levels of xylonate and lyxonate. The manufacturer of this ingredient states that the metabolites, especially threonate, increase the effectiveness of the vitamin C in the product. However, this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. There is a small, in vitro study that supports the notion that Ester-C is more potent than ascorbic acid by itself.
Ethanol;Worst;Irritant, Solvent;;
Ethoxydiglycol;Good;Solvent, Texture Enhancer;;In 2013, the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety concluded that the use of ethoxydiglycol does not pose a risk in leave-on cosmetic formulations at a maximum concentration of 2.6% “taking into account the other uses previously assessed (10% in rinse-off products, 7.0% in oxidative and 5% in non-oxidative hair dye formulation).”
Ethyl Alcohol;Worst;Irritant, Solvent;;
Ethyl Hexanediol;Average;Solvent, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural;;A synthetic, viscous alcohol that functions as a solvent and can also be a fragrance ingredient. Considered safe for use in cosmetics in concentrations up to 5%. Ethyl hexanediol is most commonly used in haircare products and cleansers. Interestingly, higher amounts of this ingredients are sometimes used as an insect repellant.
Ethylhexylglycerin;Good;Preservative, Humectant;Hydration;In 2013, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed ethylhexylglycerin as safe used in up to 8% concentration in rinse-off products and up to 2% in leave-on formulas. Studies regarding sensitization patch tests of 5% ethylhexylglycerin show that reactions to this ingredient are very rare and their occurrence in a broad population is considered low risk.
Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate;Best;UV Filters;Anti-Aging;See octinoxate
Ethylhexyl Olivate;Best;Emollient, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent;Hydration;"A natural ester of skin-conditioning fatty acids derived from olive oil. It can have an occlusive effect on skin, but that does not mean skin is suffocating; rather, the occlusive nature helps keep vital hydrating substances in skin from escaping, such as can occur in a dry (arid) environment."
Ethylhexyl Palmitate;Good;Emollient, Solvent, Texture Enhancer;Hydration;Ethylhexyl palmitate has a feel like some silicones and silicone derivatives, making it an alternative to those ingredients in certain formulations. There’s no research indicating this ingredient, which may be synthetic, plant-, or animal-derived, is a problem for skin. Paula’s Choice Skincare uses either the synthetic or plant-derived form of this ingredient depending on the product.
Ethylhexyl Stearate;Good;Emulsifier, Emollient, Texture Enhancer;Hydration;Ethylhexyl stearate also goes by the name octyl stearate and falls under a category of ingredients known as stearate esters. Stearate esters have been assessed in numerous studies by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review CIR Expert Panel with a safe track record whether used in high or low concentrations.
Ethyl Macadamiate;Good;Plant Extracts, Emollient, Emulsifier;Hydration;The ester of ethyl alcohol mixed with fatty acids from macadamia nut oil to create an emollient. On skin, ethyl macadamiate softens and conditions skin.This plant-derived or synthetically-made ingredient is sometimes used as a substitute for silicones because it imparts emollient, skin-softening properties without the greasy feel higher amounts of some silicones can have.Ethyl macadamiate also adds a pleasant slip to creams and lotions, making them easier to spread, not to mention macadamia nut oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids for skin.
Ethylparaben;Good;Preservative;;We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.
Ethyl Vanillin;Good;Antioxidant;;Flavoring agent derived from vanilla. It has antioxidant properties.
Eucalyptus Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Extract that may have a variety of benefical properties on the skin. Despite those benefits, it’s also a skin sensitizer, particularly on abraded skin.
Eucalyptus Oil;Worst;Irritant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts;;Fragrant plant oil whose active constituents are found in the leaves and in the oil obtained from them. The oil has benefits for skin, but is also a potent skin sensitizer due to its chemical components. Truly a mixed bag, this oil, like rosemary oil, has benefits and risks. Low amounts of eucalyptus oil do not seem to pose a risk of sensitivity in the general population, but its fragrance components are known sensitizers.
Eugenia Aromatica;Worst;Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Eugenia Caryophyllus;Worst;Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Eugenol;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;Volatile fragrance chemical that occurs naturally in cloves, basil, and bay leaves, among other plants. Eugenol is often part of the fragrance in cosmetics products, and is known to cause sensitivity. It is best to avoid leave-on products that contain eugenol.
Euphorbia Cerifera Wax;Good;Texture Enhancer, Emollient, Plant Extracts;Hydration;Euphorbia cerifera wax is a type of wax derived from candelilla plants, often used in lip care products for barrier protection and emollience. Also contributes to the product’s solid consistency.
Euphrasia Officinalis;Average;Plant Extracts, Irritant;;

Evodia Rutaecarpa Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;A species of Asian tree whose fragrant fruit functions as a good skin-soothing agent in traditional Chinese medicine, an assertion which has been proven via topical application to human skin.
"Ext. D&amp;C";Average;Coloring Agent/Pigment;;Type of coloring agent. According to the FDA’s website (www.fda.gov), when” Ext. D&C” is followed by a color, it means that the color is certified as safe for use only in drugs and cosmetics meant for external use, but not around the eyes or mouth. These types of coloring agents is not safe for foods.
Eyebright;Average;Plant Extracts, Irritant, Humectant;;"A plant; although the name sounds like it would be beneficial for the eye area, there are no studies demonstrating it has any benefit for the skin around the eye area. Health benefits of eyebright are largely anecdotal, though it’s possible this plant’s tannin content could aggravate skin."
Faex;Good;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;A type of compressed yeast. “Faex” is the ingredient designation required by European Union regulations.
Farnesol;Bad;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;;Extract of plants that is used in cosmetics primarily for fragrance. It may have some antioxidant properties, but there is no research showing it has any benefit on skin.
Farnesyl Acetate;Bad;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Antioxidant;;
Fatty Acid;Best;Emollient, Texture Enhancer, Emulsifier;Hydration;Substance typically found in plant and animal lipids (fat). Fatty acids include compounds such as glycerides, sterols, and phospholipids. They are used in cosmetics as emollients, texture enhancers, and, when mixed with glycerin, cleansing agents.
Fatty Alcohol;Good;Emollient, Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer;Hydration;"Made from fatty acids; fatty alcohols are used in cosmetics as thickening agents and emollients. They are not the drying or sensitizing forms of alcohol."
"FD&amp;C";Average;Coloring Agent/Pigment;;Type of coloring agent. According to the FDA, when FD&C is followed by a color, the color is certified as safe for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.
"FD&amp;C Colors";Average;Coloring Agent/Pigment;;The color of cosmetics products is often an emotional pull for many consumers. A soft pink lotion can denote a moisturizer meant to calm or soothe skin, while a bright yellow balm may be deemed energizing. Whether natural or synthetic, coloring agents in skincare products serve no purpose other than to create a perception or an emotional response to the product. Coloring agents used in makeup are a different story, as they’re used to create an endless kaleidoscope of shades.
Fennel Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Volatile, fragrant oil that can cause skin sensitivity due to its high content of fragrant chemical limonene.
Fennel Seed Extract;Worst;Plant Extracts, Irritant, Antioxidant;;Can have antioxidant properties, but on skin it can be a skin sensitizer and photosensitizer.

Ferric Ferrocyanide;Average;Coloring Agent/Pigment;;Coloring agent, also known as Iron Blue, used in cosmetics products, including those designed for use around the eye. Permanently listed (since 1978) by the FDA as safe.
Ferula Galbaniflua;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts;;
Ferulic Acid;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Ferulic acid is shown to be most effective at boosting the results from other antioxidants when used in concentrations of 0.5% or greater. It is typically not used above 1%, as doing so can impart an undesirable color to a skin care formula.
Feverfew Extract;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;Extract that can be very soothing to skin but also potentially sensitizing if a specific constituent of the feverfew plant known as parthenolide (technically, sesquiterpene lactone) is present. If the parthenolide is removed from feverfew, the ingredient is not a problem for skin and may actually be beneficial because parthenolide-free feverfew has potent skin-soothing properties and can help to diminish redness. If a skin care product contains feverfew, you must contact the company to confirm that the feverfew in their products is parthenolide-free. Note: All Paula’s Choice products that contain feverfew are parthenolide-free.
Fibronectin;Good;Humectant;Hydration;Type of protein known as a glycoprotein (protein + carbohydrate) that’s naturally found in the skin. Fibronectin’s deterioration from external factors is an element in skin aging and wrinkling. As is true for all proteins, regardless of their origin, it’s a good water-binding agent for skin. However, applying it topically doesn’t help the fibronectin in your skin.
Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Emollient;Hydration;"Fig may seem like a simple fruit often associated with the soft-textured cookies sold in grocery stores; however, it is proving to be a rather fascinating ingredient for skin.
It’s a rich source of a class of antioxidants known as phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, various epicatechins, and anthocyanins which contribute to the rich, often dark color of fig skin and the fruit inside.
Along with being an antioxidant, fig has been shown to enhance skin’s hydration by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. It can also visibly improve skin color by addressing an enzyme in skin (tyrosinase) whose overproduction can lead to dark spots.
Those benefits are intriguing, but there’s more: fig extract has also been to help reduce uncomfortably dry, tight skin, including compromised, redness-prone skin.
One caution: Fig contains a group of naturally-occurring compounds known as psoralens. These can make skin more sensitive to sun exposure, but you can get around this by using a broad spectrum sunscreen every day. The leaves, root and sap from the fig plant contain the highest concentration of psoralens, which is why the fruit portion, which contains appreciably low levels, is typically used in skin care."
Fig;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Emollient;Hydration;
Filipendula Glaberrima;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Also known as Nakai, the root of this plant extract has been shown to be a potent antioxidant.
Filipendula Rubra;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;
Film-Forming Agent;Good;Film-Forming Agent, Polymer;;"Large group of ingredients typically found in haircare products, but that also are widely used in skin care products, particularly moisturizers. Film-forming agents include PVP, acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylates, and various copolymers. When applied they leave a pliable, cohesive, and continuous covering over the hair or skin. The film has water-binding properties and leaves a smooth feel on skin. Film-forming agents can be weak skin sensitizers, but this almost always depends on the amount used; lower amounts generally are not problematic."
Fireweed Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;"Extract from the Epilobium angustifolium plant; also known as willow herb."
Fir Needle Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Volatile, fragrant oil that can cause skin sensitivity. According to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, “The essential oil also acts as a rubefacient (counterirritant) and improves circulation when applied externally.” A counterirritant is defined as any ingredient that causes sensitization or a mild swelling of the skin to alleviate uncomfortable symptoms deeper within skin.
Fish Cartilage Extract;Average;;;May have water-binding properties, but there is no research showing that this has any benefit for skin.
Flavonoid;Best;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;
Flavor;Average;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural;;According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the term “flavor” on a product label signifies “any natural or synthetic substance or substances used solely to impart a taste to a cosmetic product.” In Europe, the labeling name for flavor is “aroma”. The term “flavor” is used most often for lip-care products and lip cosmetics (think lipstick, lip gloss).Although it is basically synonymous with fragrance, listing “flavor” on products meant for application to lips is more appealing (who wants to think of ingesting fragrance?). Given that flavor can be composed of numerous ingredients, it’s a gamble as to whether or not lips will experience sensitivity. Most lip plumpers listing flavor tend to use that term to encompass flavoring agents that can have a sensitizing effect of lips, such as various types of pepper, ginger, or various forms of mint.
Flax;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Plant source of linen and edible seeds. Flax seeds and seed oil have antioxidant properties. The seeds are also a source of essential fatty acid linolenic acid.
Flaxseed Oil;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;"From seeds of the flax plant; a natural source of essential fatty acids, particularly omega-3."
Floralozone;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;One of a number of synthetic fragrant components.
Foeniculum Vulgare Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Folic Acid;Good;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;"Part of the B-vitamin complex; when taken orally, it is a good antioxidant. That benefit has not been demonstrated when it is applied topically on skin."
Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservative;Bad;Preservative;;Common type of preservative found in cosmetics. Despite some claims, there is no higher level of skin reaction to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives than to other preservatives. In fact, there is a far greater risk to skin from a product without preservatives, because of the contamination and unchecked growth of mold that can result if no preservatives are used. However, there is concern that when formaldehyde-releasing preservatives are present in a formulation that also includes amines, such as triethanolamine (TEA), diethanolamine (DEA), or monoethanolamine (MEA), nitrosamines can be formed. Nitrosamines are harmful substances that can potentially penetrate skin. Whether or not that poses a health risk of any kind has not been established.
Fragaria Vesca (Strawberry) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;"Strawberry's red colour comes from its high amount of antioxidant compounds known as anthocyanins. It's also a natural source of saccharides which help hydrate skin.Research has shown strawberry is a very good source of vitamin C. The combination of that plus the numerous other antioxidants is what allows strawberry to help skin to better withstand environmental damage; in fact, strawberry can helps shield supportive elements in skin from harm, allowing them to stay flexible and resilient longer. What's more, it does so quickly, providing this benefit within 30 minutes of application.Ellagic acid is among the primary antioxidants in strawberry, and has a documented soothing effect on skin's surface, plus contributes to strawberry being a prebiotic. This same compound is also found in pomegranate.Research has shown ellagic acid can interrupt the pathway that leads to visible skin colour changes, including dark spots. In that sense, it's a great ingredient to pair with skin tone-improvers like vitamin C, niacinamide, and arbutin.When eaten or taken as a supplement, this popular fruit has research supporting numerous health benefits related to total body wellness and the role its various antioxidants play in helping the body maintain its health."
Fragrance;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;One or a blend of volatile and/or fragrant plant oils (or synthetically derived oils) that impart aroma and odor to products. These are often skin sensitizers because they are composed of hundreds of individual chemical components. Fragrance is a leading source of sensitivity to cosmetics.
Frankincense Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;"Fragrant component used in skincare products; it can be a skin sensitizer, but is not considered a potent one. There is no research showing frankincense has any benefit for skin."

Fucus Vesiculosus Extract;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Soothing;Fucus vesiculosus extract, also known as bladderwrack, is a type of brown algae (seaweed) that is edible. Its nutrient profile benefits the body when consumed, but it can also benefit skin when applied topically. One of the more notable topical benefits is how the treasure trove of antioxidants in brown algae can help defend skin’s surface from daily exposure to airborne pollutants. The antioxidants help neutralize these substances before they cause ongoing harm. Fucus vesiculosus has an unusually high concentration of minerals, including sodium and potassium, and the full suite of essential amino acids, which can help facilitate the movement of water through skin’s uppermost layers.

Galbanum;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;Fragrant substance that, because of its resin and volatile oil content containing monoterpenes can be extremely sensitizing on abraded skin. There is no research showing it has any benefit on skin, though it has natural, short-term (6 months) preservative qualities in emulsions.
Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA);Best;Emollient, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;Fatty acid used in cosmetics as an emollient and antioxidant. GLA is considered a skin-soothing agent. It’s found in black currant oil or seeds, evening primrose oil, and borage oil.
Ganoderma Lucidum (Mushroom) Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;"Ganoderma lucidum is a species of mushroom that’s long been a staple of traditional Chinese medicine. Also known as Reishi mushroom, when applied to skin, research has shown a compound it contains (ganodermanondiol) can interrupt the enzyme tyrosinase, which in turn can visibly reduce certain types of discoloration.
Research has also shown this extract can improve skin’s supportive elements while also reducing signs of irritation. It’s a natural source of vitamin D2, skin-beneficial trace minerals such as copper and selenium, and the amino acids leucine and lysine.
As with most other types of mushrooms, Ganoderma lucidum is also a very good antioxidant. The extract form of this mushroom eliminates the water component (the whole mushroom that you’d buy in the grocery store contains over 90% water), so only a small amount is needed to get its benefits."
Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;"Mangosteen is a fruit with a sweet and sour flavor and is native to several Asian countries. The fruit is a rich source of xanthones, natural polyphenolic compounds that have documented health-promoting effects, especially when consumed orally.
Mangosteen’s dark red peel contains a rich assortment of antioxidant compounds, including flavonoids, xanthones, and anthocyanins, all of which neutralize oxidative damage. Mangosteen peel both interrupts and helps repair the visible damage from free radicals on skin; however, the peel of this plant is considered inedible, so bodily health benefits from this plant are due to consumption of the fruit portion.
On skin, all parts of the mangosteen plant exert pronounced calming benefits which helps visibly improve multiple skin concerns. This benefit mostly stems from its unique mix of antioxidants and their synergy on skin."
Gardenia Florida Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;"Flower extract used in cosmetics to impart fragrance; also functions as an antioxidant. There is limited research proving its benefit for skin, and its fragrance component may be sensitizing, thus canceling out the antioxidant benefit."
Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen) leaf oil;Worst;Irritant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts;;A type of mint that is often used for addressing the discomfort of sore muscles, but spearmint oil can be very sensitizing due to its high volume of an ingredient known as methyl salicylate.

Gentiana Lutea (Gentian) Root Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Part of the gentian plant, constituents of which have skin-soothing and antioxidant benefits.
Geraniol;Bad;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;A volatile fragrance ingredient extracted from geranium, geraniol is capable of causing sensitivity when applied to skin. However, the risk of such reaction has to do with depth of penetration into skin, and geraniol doesn’t penetrate skin easily. As such, although it’s not a great ingredient to see on a label if you have sensitive skin, it isn’t among the most troublesome fragrance ingredients when used in low concentrations. Despite the lesser concern, research has shown that, like many fragrant oil components, geraniol can oxidize in the presence of air, causing damage when appied to skin’s surface.
Geranium Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Extract that can have potent antioxidant properties. The oil form of geranium is fragrant and can be a source of sensitivity.
Geranium Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Fragrant oil that can have beneficial properties, but also can be a skin sensitizer due to its volatile fragrance ingredients.

Germaben II;Average;Preservative;;Trade name for diazolidinyl urea. Trade names are not pemitted as stand-ins for the individual ingredients on a cosmetic ingredient label.
Ginger Extract;Good;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing;Extract from a plant in the Zingiberacae family that has research showing it has soothing and potent antioxidant activity when taken orally and when applied to skin. Ginger extract is generally considered non-volatile, meaning it doesn’t pose a risk of sensitizing skin. In contrast, the oil form of ginger maintains the volatile components (ginger oil contains over 50 such components) that have the potential to aggravate skin with topical use.
Ginger Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;"A fragrant plant oil that, depending on the species, can contain dozens of volatile compounds that have a known or potential risk to sensitize skin; however, several of these fragrant compounds also have health benefits, including antioxidant benefit, when ginger oil is consumed via food as part of your diet. Therefore, ginger oil isn’t ideal for skin but can absolutely have benefit if you routinely include small amounts of fresh ginger in your diet."

Glucomannan;Best;Humectant, Plant Extracts, Polymer;Hydration;Glucomannan is prebiotic sugar that combines the simples sugars mannose with glucose. It's derived from the root of the konjac plant, and is a good source of hydrating polysaccharides for skin. As a prebiotic, glucomannan serves as a food source for the probiotics that make up each person's skin microbiome. By supplying food (energy) to your skin's probiotic strains, prebiotics like glucomannan play an important role in keeping skin's microbiome balanced, which translates to healthier-looking skin. In vitro research has shown glucomannan works with a wide range of probiotics to help control the proliferation of acne-causing bacteria on skin. It also has antioxidant ability, which isn't too surprising given glucomannan comes from a plant. Glucomannan is also a food ingredient, such as konjac flour. Research has documented its contribution to health benefits, such as weight management and controlling glucose levels in the body.
Gluconolactone;Best;Exfoliant;Evens Skin Tone, Anti-Aging, Hydration;
Glucosamine HCL;Best;Humectant;Hydration;A form of glucosamine, an amino sugar that can be considered a skin-replenishing and soothing ingredient.

Glucosylceramides;Best;Emollient;Anti-Aging, Hydration;Glucosylceramides are a type of sphingolipid (a complex, long-chain lipid) known as a glycosphingolipid. Glucosylceramides are composed of a ceramide and sugar molecule known as glucose. They're responsible for the healthy formation and appearance of skin's upper layers, known as the epidermis, and are the primary glycosphingolipid in this portion of the skin. Research has shown that oral consumption of glucosylceramides, whether from wheat, corn, rice bran, beets, or konjac root can make it from the digestion process to skin. Interestingly (but not too surprising) research has also shown that glucosylceramides have less benefit for normal skin than they do for dry, sun-damaged, or otherwise compromised skin. Plant-derived glucosylceramides can visibly repair and strengthen skin's barrier, improve hydration channels in skin, and interrupt factors in skin that trigger signs of sensitivity, dryness, and dullness. In short, glucosylceramides are proving to be an integral ingredient for healthier skin at any age, and nicely complement a range of ceramides used in topical skin care products.
Glucosyl Hesperidin;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;A water-soluble form of hesperidin, a flavonoid found in many citrus plants, as well as evening primrose oil. It has potential as an antioxidant. There are also studies showing it has skin-soothing benefits.

Glycereth-6 Laurate;Good;Emulsifier, Cleansing Agent;;Used as an emollient and thickening agent in cosmetics.
Glycerin;Best;Humectant, Texture Enhancer, Solvent;Hydration, Anti-Aging;Some people wonder whether using products with glycerin takes too much water from skin when there isn’t enough humidity in the air. This can occur with pure glycerin (that is, at a 100% concentration - an amount that’s never used in skin care products). Any humectant (including glycerin) used in pure form can increase water loss by attracting water from the lower layers of skin into the surface layers when the climate is too arid (low humidity). For this reason, glycerin and humectants are typically used in concentrations of 5% or less and always combined with other ingredients to soften skin. In fact, glycerin combined with other emollients and/or oils is a fundamental cornerstone of most moisturizers. However, amounts of 10% or greater can be used in clinical circumstances for skin healing.

Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts, Emollient;Anti-Aging, Hydration;"Glycine soja (soybean) oil is a non-fragrant plant oil with multiple uses for skin. As with all plant oils, it has skin-smoothing emollient properties, plus it’s a good source of antioxidants and replenishing fatty acids.
Studies have shown that compounds in soy, most likely isoflavones, help fade stubborn discolorations from sun exposure and other sources. They help to reduce excess transfer of melanin to skin’s surface, thereby visibly reducing hyperpigmentation.
Soybean oil’s antioxidant content includes polyphenols known as isoflavones, particularly daidzein and genistein. These have been shown to help protect skin from UV light-triggered damage. The antioxidants in soy can also help maintain hydration by preventing water loss.
In oil form, soy can help maintain skin’s smooth, supple surface thanks to its blend of fatty acids such as palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic. These fatty acids in the oil plus the naturally-present antioxidants are responsible for the soothing effect soy has in the presence of external aggressors."

Glycoproteins;Best;Humectant, Peptides;Anti-Aging;"""Glyco"" means ""sugar"", so glycoproteins are a type of protein linked to a sugar. They're considered a type of peptide and are naturally present in skin's surface as well as throughout the body. On skin, glycoproteins work with ingredients like glycerin, ceramides, and hyaluronic acids to keep skin intact, smooth, and healthy-looking. They can also enhance skin's natural resilience by reinforcing skin barrier strength. Glycoproteins help other peptides be more soluble in water and within skin, so some products add them along with specific peptides as a way to enhance delivery and stability of the formula."
Glycosaminoglycans;Best;Humectant;Hydration;Also known as mucopolysaccharides, these are a fundamental component of skin tissue, essentially a group of complex proteins. Chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid are part of this ingredient group, all of which function as skin-replenishing and restoring ingredients.

Goji Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;"This bright, warm red berry, native to Asia, is a very good source of antioxidant compounds such as phenolic acids and flavonoids that can help defend the skin and body from environmental damage, resulting in numerous potential health benefits. The polysaccharides from this plant have also proven to be a boon for health, while the antioxidant component helps mitigate signs of environmental damage when applied to skin or consumed orally. Goji is often touted as a miracle for skin and body, but that’s stretching the truth. No question it’s a very good ingredient, but it’s not the best berry out there; rather, it’s one of several great berry ingredients to consider, and the more of those you include in your skin care and in your diet, the better."
Gold;Worst;Coloring Agent/Pigment;;Common sensitizer that can induce negative responses on skin, especially on the face and eyelids. Claims of gold helping to create electric charges in skin to trigger improvement in signs of aging are completely unproven. Another form of gold used in skincare products is “colloidal gold,” which means that the gold particles have been nanosized (usually to 1-15 nanometers) so that it remains dispersed evenly throughout a solution. Although gold is a heavy metal, and heavy metals are subject to regulations, colloidal gold preparations are not regulated, so the risks are unknown. Initial research shows that it is fairly safe. Colloidal gold also is used in the world of medicine, where there is a minor amount of research that it might have benefit because of assumed skin-soothing properties. Most of that research, however, is either very old or was performed on only a very small group of people, not enough to prove efficacy. Even if gold were a good skin-soothing agent, its effects have never been compared with the effects of the numerous potent and stable skin-soothing ingredients that are commonly used in skincare products and that have a great deal of research proving their benefit and safety. What is for certain: There is no published research proving that gold, normal or colloidal in size, has any anti-aging benefits.

Grapefruit Peel Extract;Worst;Irritant, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;;Typically listed as Citrus grandis (grapefruit) peel extract on ingredient lists, the peel from this fruit is loaded with a class of ingredients known as furanocoumarins and coumarins, which are primarily responsible for what’s known as a phototoxic reaction that occurs when skin is exposed to the sun. Low amounts of this ingredients aren’t likely to be problematic, but watch out if it’s listed toward the beginning to middle of an ingredient list, especially if the product in question has a telltale grapefruit scent.
Grapefruit Seed Extract;Worst;Plant Extracts, Preservative;;Labelled as Citrus paradisi (grapefruit) seed extract, this is often claimed as a natural preservative when added to cosmetics. However, research has demonstrated that it is not an ideal preservative agent, as it cannot protect against both the most common forms of growth - even in sealed, pump-style packaging. [1,2,3] Yes, citrus extracts can have preservative-like benefits, but they’re simply not strong enough to defend against from a broad range of substances necessary to properly preserve a skin care product.
Grape Seed Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;Contains chemical constituents such as proanthocyanidins, polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, all of which are very potent antioxidants that help to diminish environmental damage.

Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Hydration;"Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil is a non-volatile, non-fragrant plant oil used as an emollient in cosmetics. Sunflower seed oil’s 60% (on average) linoleic acid content has the ability to help replenish, strengthen, and soothe skin. This oil also contains other beneficial fatty acids skin can use, including oleic, palmitic, stearic, and a small amount of omega-3 linolenic acid.
Sunflower oil is particularly beneficial for dry, dehydrated, or environmentally compromised skin because its linoleic acid content helps skin synthesize its own lipids (fats), including ceramides, visibly repairing its barrier and leading to smoother, healthier-looking skin.
Sunflower seed oil also has a natural calming effect on skin, so can be helpful for reducing signs of skin stress or irritation. In fact, research on infants with atopic dermatitis has shown that topical sunflower oil is a viable ingredient to alternate with topical steroids normally prescribed to control symptoms of this skin disorder."
Helianthus Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;
Hemp Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;From the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa. Because both hemp and marijuana are from the genus Cannabis, they are often thought (erroneously) to have similar properties. In cosmetics, hemp seed oil is used as an emollient and to supply skin with omega fatty acids it needs to replenish itself and strengthen its surface against moisture loss. Specifically, hemp seed oil contains the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Hemp seed oil also contains beneficial phospholipids, plant sterols, amino acids (it’s especially high in the amino acid arginine) and is a rich source of antioxidant vitamin E. Another benefit of hemp seed oil is that it seems to enhance the benefits of cannabidiol, also known as CBD. This is likely due to the interaction between trace amounts of cannabinoids in hemp seed oil and pure cannabidiol.

Hibiscus;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;Any of numerous types of fragrant flowers that convey antioxidant ability. According to Natural Medicine’s Comprehensive Database, “The applicable part of hibiscus is the flower, calyx or sepal, leaves, stems, and seeds. Sepal extracts contain significant amounts of vitamin C, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. The sepal also contains the highest concentration of water-soluble antioxidants.” They go on to state that the seed and leaf of hibiscus also contain significant amounts of vitamin E and that hibiscus seeds contain the highest concentration of lipid soluble antioxidants. Despite the impressive research building for various types of hibiscus, it remains a fragrant plant, with some types being notably more fragrant than others. Because fragrance is a source of sensitivity, hibiscus isn’t among the top antioxidants we’d recommend you look for when shopping for skincare, though the fragrance concern is primarily when the whole plant is used rather than isolated extracts, which may be less (or minimally) fragrant.

Lavandin Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Essential oil of the hybrid lavender plant Lavandula hybrida and used in cosmetics as a fragrance ingredient. Its sensitizer potential for skin is similar to that of lavender oil and camphor. Lavandin yields four times more oil per volume of plants than true lavender, but it is of inferior quality and has a distinct camphor scent. It is not used in perfumery, but instead to scent soaps, air fresheners, and similar items.
Lavandula Angustifolia;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Lavandula Officinalis;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Lavender Extract And Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;In-vitro research indicates that components of lavender oil, specifically linalool and linalyl acetate, can have damaging effects on skin in as low a concentration as 0.25%. When exposed to air, these components oxidize, meaning their potential for causing a reaction increases. If you’re wondering why lavender oil doesn’t appear to be problematic for some people, it’s because research has demonstrated that you don’t always need to immediately see or feel the sensitizing effects for your skin to suffer damage.
L-Cysteine;Good;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;
Lecithin;Best;Emollient, Emulsifier, Cleansing Agent;Hydration;Lecithin’s appearance as a raw material varies based on the origin and extraction process, but in cosmetic use it typically presents as a viscous liquid or as powder. In a safety assessment conducted in 2020, the highest concentration of lecithin that was reported was 50% in a leave-on foot product, which was deemed safe. Facial skin care products typically safely contain much lower concentrations than that, usually between 0.5-2%.
Lemon;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Antioxidant;;Citrus fruit that’s a potent skin sensitizer.The juice from lemon is often touted as being a natural option for brightening skin. The truth is that lemon juice is highly acidic (has a very low pH of 2) and exceedingly sensitizing to skin. Lemon juice applied to skin can cause photosensitivty on exposure to sunlight, which is due to a volatile fragrance chemical known as limonene, which is abundant in lemon juice. Lemon, whether in juice or oil form, is a must to avoid in cosmetics.
Lemon Balm;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;
Lemongrass Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;;Extract that can have beneficial properties, but it also may be a skin sensitizer.
Lemongrass Oil;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant;;Also known as Oil of Verbena. As a volatile fragrant oil, it contains compounds (including limonene and citral) that can cause sensitivity when applied to skin.
Lemon Juice;Worst;Irritant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts;;The juice from the citrus fruit lemon, often touted in the world of skin care as being a natural option for brightening skin. The truth is that lemon juice is highly acidic, with a very low pH that’s exceedingly sensitizing to skin. Lemon juice has a pH of 2, and comparing an ingredient with that pH to just one number up (that being pH 3) is like the difference between a minor tremor in the ground and a catastrophic earthquake. Lemon juice applied to skin can cause photosensitivity, which is due to a volatile fragrance chemical known as limonene, which is abundant in lemon juice. Bottom line: There’s no research showing that lemon juice has a positive effect on brightening an uneven skin tone, yet it’s clear this ingredient is a potent skin sensitizer. Given its antioxidant content, lemon juice has its benefits, but far better to consume it orally than apply it topically.
Lemon Oil;Worst;Irritant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts;;Commonly used citrus oil that can be a skin sensitizer, especially on abraded skin. Lemon oil has limited research proving any benefits for skin. As with many fragrant oils, lemon oil has antioxidant components that can be beneficial, but there’s no valid reason to tolerate the bad to get the good. Lemon oil contains numerous fragrance chemicals that can cause a reaction when on skin that’s subsequently exposed to sunlight. Examples of the fragrance chemicals in lemon oil include limonene, bergapten, and oxypeucedanin. Although it smells great, fragrance is not skincare! The major fragrance chemical in lemon oil is limonene.

Edelweiss contains lignans, one of the constituents that have a natural skin-calming benefit. Edelweiss also contains a compound known as leontopodic acid, which research has shown strengthens skin’s barrier and helps reduce signs of sensitivity. In doing so, it helps skin’s surface become more resistant to environmental aggressors, including some types of airborne pollutants.

Leucine;Best;Humectant;Hydration;Amino acid.
Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate;Good;Plant Extracts, Preservative;;A preservative created by fermenting Raphanus sativus (radish) roots with the microorganism, Leuconostoc, a bacteria from lactic acid. Small amounts (typically 0.5%) are used in cosmetics to protect them from a wide range of harmful substances that can contaminate the product and alter its effectiveness. Interestingly, the two compounds believed to be responsible for this ingredient’s preservative action are salicylic acid and an ammonium salt. It seems neither comes from fermentation, but is present because these ingredients are used in soil to manage the growth of radishes, ensuring consistent sizes and coloration.
Levisticum Officinale Root Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts;;
Licorice Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Dark Spot Fading, Soothing, Anti-Aging;Plant extract that has skin-soothing properties. In addition, licorice root may be effective in improving the look of an uneven skin tone. One of its components, known as glabridin, is a potent antioxidant and skin-soothing ingredient, which is why licorice often shows up in products meant for sensitive, reddened skin.
Licorice Root;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Dark Spot Fading, Soothing, Anti-Aging;
Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract;Average;Plant Extracts;;Extract derived from the white lily bulb. There is no research showing this has any benefit for skin.
Lime Oil And Extract;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Citrus fruit whose volatile compounds are skin sensitizers and photosensitizers. Lime oil is a known fragrance sensitizer that contains the fragrance chemicals bergapten and limonene, both of which can cause what’s known as a photosenstive reaction when applied to skin. A phototoxic reaction can result in a patchy, uneven appearance to skin. Although lime extract and oil may have some antioxidant activity, their sensitizer potential outweighs any benefit.
Limnanthes Alba;Best;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging;"Plant commonly known as meadowfoam; its seed oil is a non-volatile plant oil used as a skin-softening agent."
Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Plant Extracts;Hydration;"Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil is a non-fragrant, edible plant oil originally developed as an agricultural crop in the 1950s. It functions as an emollient and softening agent in skin care and hair care products.
This plant oil is exceedingly stable because it is primarily composed of long chain fatty acids, the type most resistant to rancidity when exposed to oxygen. Among plant oils, meadowfoam has the highest concentration (95%) of these highly stable fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to products that would otherwise be prone to spoiling quickly.
Meadowfoam seed oil contains two compounds known as glucosinolate derivatives, 3-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate (MBITC) and 3-methoxyphenyl acetonitrile. Research has shown these compounds can inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure (but just to be clear, these ingredients do not replace the need for broad spectrum sunscreen).
The glucosinolate derivatives are not direct antioxidants (indeed, meadowfoam seed oil isn’t a good source of antioxidants), but they can positively influence skin’s own antioxidant defenses, which is a nice benefit.
Meadowfoam seed oil can also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into soil and across animal skin; however, to date the same benefit hasn’t been shown to occur on human skin. On the upside, the long-chain fatty acids in this plant oil have chemical similarity to some of the fatty acids found in skin’s own oil, so in theory it’s certainly possible meadowfoam oil would help deliver other oil-based (lipophilic) ingredients to skin."
Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent;Hydration;
Limonene;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;"Like most volatile fragrance components, limonene also has strong antioxidant benefits and has also been shown to calm skin; however, when exposed to air these highly volatile antioxidant compounds oxidize and become capable of sensitizing skin."
Linalool;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Fragrant component of lavender and coriander that can be a potent skin sensitizer.

Linolenic Acid;Best;Emollient, Cleansing Agent;Hydration;Naturally occurring, colorless polyunsaturated fatty acid liquid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and skin-restorative ingredient. Also known as alpha-linolenic acid, this ingredient is a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid that occurs in vegetable oil and flax seed oil as well as canola and soy oils. Walnuts are a top dietary source of this fatty acid. Linolenic acid has research showing topical application helps improve many skin concerns.
Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Antioxidant, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent;Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing;"Linum usitastissimum (linseed) seed oil is more commonly known as flaxseed oil. It’s a significant plant source of omega fatty acids, primarily an omega-3 fatty acid (linolenic acid) that’s been shown to have a soothing effect on skin.
These polyunsaturated fatty acids, which also include oleic, linoleic, palmitic and stearic acids, enhance skin’s hydration by preventing moisture loss. Linseed/flax oil has been shown to penetrate skin’s uppermost layers easily, carrying other beneficial ingredients with it (but those ingredients also have to be oil soluble so, for example, linseed wouldn’t be a good carrier for water-soluble vitamin C but is great for delivering oil-soluble vitamin E).
Linseed oil is also a top source of lignans, phenolic plant compounds that have antioxidant ability."
Linum Usitatissimum Extract;Best;Plant Extracts;;

Lupine Oil;Best;Antioxidant, Emollient, Plant Extracts;Hydration, Anti-Aging;
Lupinus Albus (White Lupine) Seed Oil;Best;Antioxidant, Emollient, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing;"Lupinus albus (white lupine) seed oil is a non-fragrant plant oil whose unsaturated fatty acid content consists primarily of oleic and erucic acids. Oleic acid can help beneficial compounds in plant oils and extracts penetrate further into skin, while omega-9 fatty acid erucic acid works with the other fatty acids in this plant oil to hydrate and strengthen skin. Lupine seed oil also contains omega-3 linolenic acid and omega-6 linoleic acid, both of which help calm skin and visibly repair its barrier. Moving away from fatty acid content, white lupine oil is also high in protein and a good source of the hydrating amino acid lysine. Note that the seed oil from this plants comes in bitter and sweet varieties; the bitter form contains a much higher amount of substances known as alkaloids, which are potential skin sensitizers. The sweet form, which is what Paula's Choice uses, only contains trace levels of these problematic compounds, too low to upset skin. The sweet form of this plant oil is a better source of antioxidant vitamin E, but both types are respectable sources of antioxidants."

It can be synthetic, animal-derived, or can come from plants, with Paula's Choice opting to use the plant-derived version. Magnesium palmitoyl glutamate is often used as part of a blend with other amino acids. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics. The magnesium portion easily penetrates skin's uppermost layers where it delivers this micro-nutrient's hydration-boosting benefits.
Magnesium PCA;Best;Humectant;Hydration;"Magnesium PCA is the magnesium salt of PCA (pyrrolidone carboxylic acid), which is part of skin's intercellular matrix. Magnesium PCA therefore plays an influential role in what's known as skin's natural moisturizing factor. As an electrolyte mineral, magnesium plays a role in enhancing skin hydration and barrier repair. It also influences how skin cells move through skin's surface layers, how they shed, and how skin responds to external stimuli. Interestingly, pure magnesium and some forms such as magnesium chloride have a difficult time penetrating skin; however, linking magnesium with PCA or lactic acid (as in magnesium lactate) helps to overcome this issue, allowing skin to benefit."

Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;"Acerola fruit extract is a potent source of antioxidants and hydrating polysaccharides, some of which have been shown to protect fibroblasts in skin from suffering oxidative damage, which in turn leads to younger-looking skin.
The fruit is rich in vitamin C, beta-carotene, several polyphenols (all working as antioxidants), and the B vitamin folate.
The yellow- to red-toned ripe acerola fruit can also prevent lipids such as our skin’s oil from free radical damage. It’s truly a multi-faceted antioxidant plant extract that can benefit all skin types and is also a proven “superfood” ingredient that has been shown to benefit skin when consumed orally, largely due to its ability to reduce inflammation. Acerola is sometimes referred to as Barbados cherry or the acerola cherry."
Maltodextrin;Good;Absorbent, Film-Forming Agent, Humectant;Oil Control, Hydration;A plant-based sugar created by hydrolyzing a saccharide with starch from corn, potato, or rice.

Mandelic Acid;Good;Exfoliant;Smooths Bumpy Skin, Evens Skin Tone;A couple studies have shown that mandelic acid and salicylic acid worked well together in a higher-strength peel for use on darker skin tones struggling with discolorations, including post-acne marks. However, what we don’t know is how well mandelic acid would’ve worked on its own - it’s possible the results were more from salicylic acid than the combination of the two acids. Other research has shown mandelic acid can increase sebum (oil) production, which isn’t great for oily skin but would be a benefit for dry skin.
Manganese Gluconate;Average;Humectant, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Hydration;Mineral found in trace amounts in tissues of the body. While manganese plays a vital role in the processes of many body systems, there is no evidence it serves any purpose topically on skin, though it may act as an antioxidant.

This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing."
Menthyl Lactate;Worst;Irritant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural;;The ester of menthol and lactic acid, this ingredient is used as a cooling or flavoring agent and fragrance in cosmetics. This derivative of menthol is supposed to be less sensitizing than menthol, but there’s no substantiated, pubsliehd research supporting this notion. Menthyl lactate may be synthetic, plant-derived, or animal-derived.
Meradimate;Best;UV Filters;Anti-Aging;"Also known as menthyl anthranilate, this synthetic sunscreen active is a partially effective UVA sunscreen, but because it only protects up to 336 nanometers, it does not make the grade for providing sufficient UVA protection on its own.

Methionine;Good;Antioxidant, Humectant;Anti-Aging, Hydration;
Methylchloroisothiazolinone;Worst;Preservative, Irritant;;In combination with methylisothiazolinone, it goes by the trade name Kathon CG (among others). Introduced into cosmetics in the mid-1970s, it elicited a great number of sensitizations in consumers. This led to it not being included in cosmetics other than rinse-off products. When combined with methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone offers preservative benefit. This blend is used in many products instead of parabens, despite the fact that parabens have a better safety track record and lower incidence of causing a sensitizing reaction.

Methylisothiazolinone;Worst;Preservative, Irritant;;Preservative that’s generally recommended for use only in rinse-off products such as cleansers or shampoos. Methylisothiazolinone is known to be sensitizing when used in leave-on products. Its use in both rinse-off and leave-on cosmetics products is restricted to low amounts as a means to avoid sensitivity while maintaining its efficacy as a preservative, but even in the low amount permitted (0.01%) has raised questions about it being more sensitizing than most other preservatives.
Methylparaben;Good;Preservative;;We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

Mineral Oil;Good;Emollient, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Solvent;Hydration;Clear, odorless oil derived from petroleum that is widely used in cosmetics. Despite mineral oil’s association with petroleum and the hype that it’s bad for or ages skin, keep in mind that petroleum is a natural ingredient derived from the earth. Once it’s purified to become mineral oil USP (cosmetics- and pharmaceutical-grade mineral oil), it has no resemblance to the original petroleum and isn’t a source of contaminants.Cosmetics-grade mineral oil and petrolatum are considered the safest, most non-sensitizing moisturizing ingredients ever found. Mineral oil and petrolatum are known to be efficacious in skin replenishing and are also among the most effective, established moisturizing ingredients available. The mineral oil in skincare products is certified as either USP (United States Pharmacopeia) or BP (British Pharmacopeia).

Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Hydration, Anti-Aging;A non-fragrant plant oil that contains several antioxidants, including zeatin, quercetin, and vitamins A, C, and E. The oil is also a very good source of oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid that can replenish skin and help guard against moisture loss. There's more: Moringa seed oil contains amino acids as well as plant sterols which can have a calming effect on skin. In short, it's one of the better plant oils for skin, and its monounsaturated fat content gives it a lighter, less greasy feel than highly saturated oils like coconut.
Morus Alba (White Mulberry) Root Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing;"Morus alba (white mulberry) root extract has antioxidant properties, but its main benefit for skin has to do with calming signs of irritation along with its potential to fade the look of discolorations and uneven skin tone.
White mulberry root contains compounds known as flavonoids, some of which have been shown to interrupt the process that keeps discolorations looking more apparent.
Interestingly, some research has shown that mulberry twigs work in a different manner to improve uneven skin color, as the twig contains a different mix of beneficial ingredients than the root. The same is true for the leaves of this plant, which are a rich source of the skin tone-improving antioxidant oxyresveratrol (although this compound is also present in the root, it’s more concentrated in the leaf).
Overall, topical application of this plant extract helps calm stressed skin, which in turn reduces signs of environmental damage and fosters a brighter, more radiant skin tone."

Myrciaria Dubia (Camu Camu) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging;A small berry that, especially when fully ripe, possesses strong antioxidant capacity due to its levels of vitamin C, phenolic compounds, and other plant chemicals.Camu camu is a very juicy berry but a sharply acidic flavor, which is why it's rarely eaten in its natural state (similar to how cranberries in their natural state are very tart, but become palatable when mixed with sugar).Along with the components mentioned above, camu camu is also a source of minerals including sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and copper. The fruit is also a source of fatty acids such as oleic acid as well as amino acids.All told, camu camu ranks among the most effective berries in terms of its antioxidant content and ability to thwart a wide range of damaging free radicals.Interestingly, despite having a very high vitamin C content, approximately 26% of it is lost during processing and storage, one more reason to ensure any product you use that contains this ingredient is airless or highly air-restrictive (no jars or clear packaging).

Olive Oil/Olive Fruit Oil;Good;Emollient, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Hydration;Emollient plant oil (Latin name Olea europaea) with benefits similar to several other non-fragrant plant oils. Olive oil is beneficial for dry skin because of its fatty acid content, some of which comes from the emollient squalene. Olive oil contains essential fatty acids dry skin needs, including oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids. It also contains phenolic compounds that provide antioxidant benefit. A small number of animal tests show that topically applied olive oil can protect against environmental damage. This plant oil maintains a low potential for sensitivity. To be very clear: When olive oil is mixed in a formula in small amounts with other beneficial ingredients, you get the benefit of its slip and emollient properties along with some antioxidant benefit. The negative effects of olive oil are apparent only when used alone on skin.
Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emollient, Emulsifier;Hydration;"Olive oil PEG-7 esters comes from a process known as transesterification, where pure olive oil is combined with PEG-7, which is a synthetic humectant and solvent.

Palmitic Acid;Good;Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;Fatty acid found naturally in skin and used as the basis for many palmitate ingredients, such as isopropyl palmitate. Palmitic acid has many functions in cosmetics, from detergent cleansing agent to emollient. In a cleanser, it has the potential to be drying depending on what it’s combined with and the cleanser’s pH level. In moisturizers, palmitic acid is a very good emollient.
Palmitoyl Dipeptide-10;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;Palmitoyl dipeptide-10 is a synthetic peptide made of palmitic acid and dipeptide-10, which contains the amino acids alanine and histidine.
Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;Palmitoyl hexapeptide-12 is most often used on its own rather than being part of a blend with other peptides, although such blends are available.
Palmitoyl Oligopeptide;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;Synthetic blend of the fatty acid palmitic acid with several amino acids. Also known as pal-KTTKS. Theoretically, many peptides have skin-restoring ability. Palmitoyl oligopeptide was the former catchall name for a handful of peptides, including palmitoyl hexapeptide-12. As more peptides were synthesized for use in skincare, specific names were developed to avoid confusion.
Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;Trade name Matrixyl, a fatty acid mixed with amino acids. Manufactured by the French lab Sederma, it is used primarily as an ingredient in cosmetics making anti-wrinkle claims. Studies both from Sederma and from independent researchers have shown palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 can have an impact on the visual signs of aging, including fine lines and wrinkles.
Palmitoyl Proline;Best;Humectant;Hydration;Palmitoyl proline combines fatty acid palmitic acid with the amino acid proline. It may be synthetic, animal-derived, or plant-derived (Paula's Choice uses the latter). On skin, palmitoyl proline acts as a surface treatment by contributing a soft feeling. It also helps cosmetic pigments stay blended in a formula. The proline component can help shore up skin's natural supportive elements while the palmitic acid portion prevents moisture loss.
Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;Synthetic peptide that’s part of Matrixyl 3000, which also contains palmitoyl oligopeptide, and is believed to work as a skin-restoring ingredient with anti-aging benefits. This peptide is composed of four amino acids plus fatty acid palmitic acid to enhance stability and penetration into the skin. Peptides have different functions on skin, and this particular peptide, on its own or as part of Matrixyl 3000, helps to replenish skin’s surface and calm visible signs of sensitization.
Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel looked at personal care products using palmitoyl tripeptide-1 between 0.0000001% to 0.001% and deemed it was safe in current practice of use and concentration. As with most lab-made peptides, a little goes a long way.
Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;An ingredient manufactured by the brand Sederma under the trade name MATRIXYL synthe’6. The only research so far showing this ingredient’s benefit comes from the brand. That research followed 25 women between the ages of 42 to 70 years old who had forehead lines and crow’s feet. After two months, the women reported a decrease in signs of aging of 31% in some cases, and up to 100% in others using a 2% concentration of MATRIXYL synthe’6 versus the placebo.

PEG;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emollient, Emulsifier;;"PEG is an acronym for polyethylene glycol, an amazingly versatile ingredient in skin care products because of the many uses it has and its broad compatibility with different types of ingredients. PEG is often mixed with an array of hydrating emollients, beneficial fatty acids, and cleansing agents. In these various combinations, a PEG can be used in gentle cleansers, elegant moisturizers, sunscreens, and unique treatment products.
The safety of PEG in its various forms has recently been questioned. The primary concern is that they can contain problematic impurities such as ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane. Both of these are by-products from the manufacturing process, not something natural to any form of PEG. Although this was once a concern, reputable cosmetic ingredient suppliers have long since eliminated these impurities from the finished ingredient, which makes PEGs safe for skin.
What is most notable about the various forms of PEG studied to date is they have been shown to be non-irritating for skin or eyes, even when used in concentrations greater than what most skin care products contain. PEGs also widely considered non-toxic because they do not penetrate intact skin. However, as is true for even the gentlest ingredients, when skin is inflamed or compromised, the risk of irritation is increased.
If you’ve seen conflicting information about PEG ingredients, it’s important to know that the conclusions were not applicable to how PEGs are used in skin care products. These studies involved feeding a large amount of PEG to animals or applying very high doses (literally hundreds of magnitudes greater than what is used in topical products) to mouse skin."

Pentapeptide-59;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging, Soothing;Pentapeptide-59 is a biomimetic (a synthetic ingredient that mimics the processes of a natural ingredient) peptide that contains the amino acids arginine, histidine, phenylalanine and valine. On skin, it has been shown to reduce signs of sensitization, including visibly reducing redness. It also helps skin become less sensitive by neutralizing signals in skin's uppermost layers that would otherwise appear as signs of sensitivity. In order to deliver this peptide to skin and keep it stable during use, it's typically paired with emollient fatty acids such as shea butter or lecithin.
Pentapeptides;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging;Pentapeptides are a type of peptide where the peptide has five (”penta”) amino acids. There are dozens of pentapeptides used in cosmetic products, with some having more research than others, though most have at least some research from the company that developed and sells the peptide (or peptide blend) to cosmetics companies. Examples of pentapeptides include myristoyl pentapeptide-10 and acetyl pentapeptide-1. Such peptides are theorized to function as skin-restorative ingredients. Still, pentapeptides likely help boost skin’s moisture content and they’re not harmful ingredients.
Pentasodium Pentetate;Good;Chelating Agent;;Used as a chelating agent in cosmetics to prevent various mineral components from binding together and negatively affecting the formulation.
Pentylene Glycol;Good;Humectant, Solvent, Preservative;Hydration;"There have been some reports that pentylene glycol (along with other glycols) is a skin sensitizer; however, as with many ingredients, the amount and how it’s used are key. In cosmetics formulations the concentration of pentylene glycol ranges from 0.001% to 5%, an amount which the Cosmetics Ingredient Review panel has deemed safe to use in leave-on products."
Peppermint;Worst;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts;;Both the oil and the extract can have beneficial properties, but they can also have a sensitizing effect on skin. Peppermint oil is a more potent sensitizer than peppermint water.

The oil contains 44% menthol, an ingredient believed to be largely responsible for peppermint oil’s benefits as well as its risks.
Peptides;Best;Peptides;Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing;But despite claims to the contrary, peptides cannot plump lips (at least not to a noticeable extent), stop sagging skin, work just like cosmetic corrective procedures, or eliminate dark circles or puffy eyes. You’ll see all of these claims and more on products with peptides, but such claims are not supported by published, peer-reviewed research.
Perilla Ocymoides;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;Also known as beefsteak plant. Like many plants, the leaves contain flavones which help the plant survive in natural sunlight. Although the oil from this plant is best avoided due to the risk of skin sensitivity, its extracts may have soothing activity as well as functioning as antioxidants.
Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil;Best;Emollient, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Hydration, Anti-Aging, Soothing;"Persea gratissima is the Latin name for avocado, and the oil from this fruit is an excellent source of skin-replenishing fatty acids, including omega-3 linolenic acid, omega-6 linoleic acid, oleic acid, and beta sitosterol. These work on skin’s surface to preserve moisture and prevent water loss that can lead to signs of dehydrated skin.
Avocado oil not only replenishes, smooths, and softens skin, it’s also able to visibly calm skin and is a good source of natural antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, D, and E. On compromised skin, avocado oil has been shown to boost skin’s hydroxyproline content, an amino acid that plays a key role in reinforcing a firm feeling along with strengthening skin’s barrier.
Oil from the avocado seed is a good source of a group of antioxidants known as polyphenols, which includes catechin, epicatechin, and 3-leucoanthocyanidins. These have a synergistic effect on neutralizing many types of free radicals before they can damage skin."

Phenylalanine;Good;Humectant, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;
Phenylethyl Resorcinol;Average;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading;"Synthetic antioxidant often seen in skin-brightening products. The most compelling research looked at the results of a cream with phenylethyl resorcinol plus three other skin-brightening agents. The product was applied over a period of 3 months by 20 women, all of whom also used sunscreen. At the end of the study, it was determined that the women’s uneveness decreased by 43%. The problem is we don’t know how much of this improvement is due to phenylethyl resorcinol, as it wasn’t used alone, which is the case with most products using this ingredient as a means to improve the appearance of an uneven skin tone. Until more research comes to light, this isn’t an ingredient to bank on for great results if an uneven skin tone is your concern; however, it’s fine to use in products that also contain other skin-brightening ingredients with established track records of success."
Phenyl Trimethicone;Good;Silicone, Emollient;Hydration;Phenyl trimethicone is a silicone with a drier finish than dimethicone. In skin care, it functions as an occlusive and conditioning agent, contributing to a product’s silky texture and feel on skin. It’s one of the better silicone ingredients for those with dry skin due to its higher viscosity.
Phloretin;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone;A flavonoid substance derived from apples and the bark of apple trees. As for topical application to skin, research has shown that it has antioxidant ability, can improve the look of an uneven skin tone, and also serves as a penetration enhancer, which means it can, when properly formulated, help other beneficial ingredients go beyond the superficial layers of skin.
Phosphatidylcholine;Best;Emollient, Emulsifier, Cleansing Agent;Hydration;Active ingredient in lecithin. PC is considered a very good water-binding agent and aids in the penetration of other ingredients into the skin.

Phosphatidylethanolamine;Best;Humectant;Hydration, Dark Spot Fading;
Phospholipid;Best;Humectant, Emollient, Antioxidant;Hydration;"Phospholipids are types of lipids (fats) composed of glycerol, fatty acids, and phosphate (a salt made from the non-metallic element phosphorus). They occur naturally within the human body and can be derived from plant and animal sources, such as soybeans, egg yolks, and milk. Phospholipids can also be synthetically derived. Lecithin is an example of a phospholipid.
Phospholipids in skin care have value for numerous reasons– chief among them is that they are hygroscopic, meaning they pull in water from surrounding air and hold it where more hydration is needed. That means they have excellent moisturizing capabilities without being occlusive.
Applying phospholipids to skin can help replace phospholipids that are depleted either through cleansing or from environmental factors. Research also shows that phospholipids can have antioxidant properties and be effective in helping deliver other ingredients more effective to skin in cosmetics.
As skin-natural ingredients, phospholipids are considered safe as used in skin care in concentrations up to 50%; however, they are most often used as part of a blend with glycerin, lecithin (itself a source of phospholipids as stated above) and ceramides."

Studies support the claim that pycnogenol is a potent antioxidant that can help neutralize oxidative stress. There is also a great deal of research backing pycnogenol as an oral supplement for its anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant benefits, and regeneration of skin’s elasticity.

Despite this disappointment, apple stem cells maintain their antioxidant benefit."
Quaternary Ammonium Compounds;Good;Cleansing Agent;;A wide range of ingredients, called “quats” for short, that share a unique molecular structure that makes them strongly attracted to hair. When one end of the quat grabs the hair, the other end sticks out, providing a handle for another quat molecule to grab onto. This linking creates a lineup on the hair that resembles a temporarily smooth surface, allowing combs and brushes to more easily glide through hair. Found primarily in shampoos, rinse-off and leave-in conditioners, and any product that claims to detangle the hair, these less-than-poetic-sounding ingredients are essential for having manageable hair. Typical quats on an ingredient list include guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, dicetyldimonium chloride, dihydrogenated tallow benzylmonium chloride, behentrimonium chloride, behenalkonium betaine, benzalkonium chloride, quaternium 18, stearalkonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride, and many more.

In terms of skincare, research has shown that a lipid-based delivery system is optimal for quercetin to exert antioxidant benefits. Even more exciting, this type of formula provides an initial burst of quercetin followed by sustained release over a 24-hour period. When quercetin is mixed with silicone and lipids, the intake is greater, as confirmed by testing on human skin.

Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract;Good;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Soothing;"Scutellaria baicalensis root extract comes from a flowering plant native to China, where it’s been used for years as one of the many herbal preparations within the field of Chinese medicine. In China, the extract is known as Huang-Qin or golden herb, because the root is a golden yellow color.
It’s primarily used in cosmetics for its promising ability to interrupt the creation and transfer of excess pigment; however, these scientific studies were done in vitro on skin cells, not intact skin on people struggling with dark spots, so what seems exciting in a lab setting may not hold as much promise for topical use. The other issue is the current lack of agreement on how much of this root extract is needed to visibly fade skin discolorations; some say 0.1% is enough, others recommend at least a 1% concentration is necessary, and some blends with this ingredient encourage amounts of 3-10% if the goal is visible improvement of skin color.
The root is more exciting because it contains baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A, all of which are flavones, a type of antioxidant that lend color to various plants and are known to be soothing. Scutellaria baicalensis root can help skin better withstand environmental aggressors that can worsen the look of many common skin concerns, so it certainly has value.
Testing on mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig skin revealed that a standardized extract of this ingredient is not irritating or sensitizing, even when the skin was compromised. The conclusion was that Scutellaria baicalensis is a viable option for sensitive skin struggling with signs of uneven skin tone or just in need of soothing."

Silk Protein;Good;Antioxidant, Peptides;Anti-Aging;There is a small amount of research showing silk protein may have topical antioxidant properties.
Siloxane;Good;Silicone, Texture Enhancer, Film-Forming Agent;;
Silt;Good;Absorbent, Humectant;Oil Control, Hydration;A sediment obtained from various bodies of water. Silt’s absorbent nature helps it function to absorb excess surface oil. Most types of silt contain a small amount (12% or less) or natural clay.
Silver;Worst;Irritant, Coloring Agent/Pigment;;"Metallic element that in cosmetics can have disinfecting properties; however, prolonged contact can turn skin grayish blue. Silver can be sensitizing to skin, and can cause silver toxicity."
Silver Chloride;Average;Irritant;;An inorganic salt that has no known function in cosmetics.
Silver Tip White Tea Leaf Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing;
Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Soothing;Silymarin also has research on its role in interrupting pathways in skin that lead to discolorations on skin’s surface, while that and other compounds in milk thistle seem, at least in a lab setting, to have an inhibitory effect on enzymes that degrade collagen. In short, it’s an impressive antioxidant to see in skin care products, particularly those that address environmental stressors.
Silybum Marianum Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Soothing;
Silybum Marianum Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing, Dark Spot Fading;"Some research indicates that extraction via ethanol is preferred because when cold-pressed, the seed oil’s silymarin content is lower; however, cold pressing releases more of the silymarin derivative silybin, which is an even more potent antioxidant and skin soother than silymarin. Either method provides a good source of alpha tocopherol (vitamin E), phospholipids, and squalene as well as polyphenols such as vanillic acid and p-coumaric."
Simethicone;Good;Silicone;;"Mixture of dimethicone with silica; related to silicones, but used as an anti-foaming agent."
Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging, Soothing;
Skin-Replenishing Ingredients;Best;Humectant, Emollient;Hydration, Anti-Aging;There are numerous skin-replenishing ingredients to consider, some of which are naturally present in skin, including hyaluronic acid, ceramides, sodium PCA, glycerin, glycerol, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Other examples of research-proven skin-replenishing ingredients are silicones, petrolatum, triglycerides, omega fatty acids, and exfoliating ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs like glycolic acid) and beta hydroxy acid (BHA, salicylic acid).
Skin-Restoring Ingredients;Best;Antioxidant, Peptides;Anti-Aging;Skin care ingredients that nourish skin’s surface in a way that helps transform it on many levels to appear noticeably younger, with a renewed feeling of firmness, and a more even-looking complexion. With ongoing use, these ingredients also help improve dull skin tone and rough texture, plus soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including deep wrinkles. Well-researched examples of skin-restoring ingredients include retinol, niacinamide, peptides, linoleic and linolenic acids, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (found in green tea), and adenosine.
Skullcap Extract;Good;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing, Anti-Aging;Herbal extract that has antioxidant and soothing properties for skin.
Slip Agent;Good;Humectant, Texture Enhancer;Hydration;Term used to describe a range of ingredients that help other ingredients spread over skin and penetrate into it. Slip agents also have humectant properties. Slip agents include butylene glycol, glycerin, polysorbates, and propylene glycol, to name a few. They are as basic to the world of skincare as water.
Slippery Elm Bark;Average;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing, Anti-Aging;Plant that can be a good skin-soothing agent but can also be an allergen if used in high amounts.
Soap;Worst;Cleansing Agent, Irritant;;True “soaps” are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and are not required to list their ingredients on the label. They are made up solely of fats and alkali. Many bar cleansers are not soaps, but contain synthetic detergent cleansing agents and various thickening agents that keep the bar in its bar form. Most soaps are considered very drying due to their alkaline base (i.e., a pH over 8). Bar cleansers can be gentler than bar soaps, but are more often than not still drying, depending on their composition.
Soapberry Extract;Good;Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Soothing;Extract from the tree Sapindus saponaria. The berries contain a good amount of saponins.
Soapwort;Good;Plant Extracts, Cleansing Agent;;Plant from which is derived an extract with detergent cleansing properties.

This means using highly purified copolymers to avoid residues (known as monomers) that can irritate skin. Paula's Choice follows this practice whenever we use acrylate ingredients."
Sodium Ascorbate;Best;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Dark Spot Fading;
Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate;Best;Antioxidant;Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Dark Spot Fading;Along with other forms of vitamin C, it is considered safe as used in skin care products. This versatile form of vitamin C works in both water- and oil-based formulas without breaking down, but despite this impressive stability, packaging is still important. This is because such stability isn’t impenetrable, meaning ongoing exposure to light and air can still weaken its efficacy, although certainly not as quickly as occurs with pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
Sodium Benzoate;Good;Preservative;;The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled sodium benzoate safe as used in cosmetics, where maximum usage levels range from 0.5–1%. In its raw form, sodium benzoate is a white, crystalline solid that dissolves in water.
Sodium Bicarbonate;Average;pH Adjuster/Stabilizer;;"A synthetic inorganic salt more commonly known as baking soda. It has many functions in cosmetics, including pH adjuster, buffering agent, and abrasive, such as in face or body scrubs. When used in small amounts to adjust and maintain the pH of cosmetic products, baking soda is not a problem for skin; however, when used among the main ingredient in scrub products, it’s simply too abrasive and an ingredient we don’t recommend. The rating for this ingredient pertains to its benefit as a pH adjuster and buffering agent."
Sodium Bisulfite;Average;Antioxidant, Irritant;;Used in acid-type permanent waves to alter the shape of hair. It is less damaging than alkaline permanent waves, but also has limitations regarding how much change it can effect in hair. It can be a skin sensitizer.
Sodium Borate;Worst;pH Adjuster/Stabilizer;;
Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate;Worst;Cleansing Agent, Irritant;;Used primarily as a detergent cleansing agent, but is potentially drying and can aggravate skin. Can be derived from coconut. It’s tricky to include in formulas due to stability issues, but it does produce copious foam.
Sodium Carbomer;Good;Film-Forming Agent, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer;;Sodium carbomer is a blend of sodium (salt) and carbomer that functions as a stabilizer and film-forming agent.
Sodium Carbonate;Worst;Absorbent, Irritant;Oil Control;"Absorbent salt used in cosmetics; it can also be a skin sensitizer."

Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate;Good;Cleansing Agent;;Cleansing agent derived from coconut oil. This ingredient is also used to help soften (remove excess minerals from) hard water.
Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate;Good;Cleansing Agent;;Sodium cocoyl glycinate is an amino acid-derived cleansing and skin-softening ingredient that sometimes also shows up in hair care products. It may be animal- or plant-derived or, as is often the case, synthetic, but is typically created from coconut fatty acids and the amino acid glycine. As a cleansing agent, sodium cocoyl glycinate is considered mild and non-drying. It's one of the few cleansing agents that naturally produces a creamy-feeling lather. It's considered safe and non-irritating to skin as used in cosmetic products.
Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate;Good;Cleansing Agent;;"Sodium cocoyl isethionate is derived from coconut, and is a mild soap-free cleansing agent known for its ability to mitigate disruption to skin's barrier; compatible with sensitive skin."

Its ceramide-like structure has a high affinity for skin.
Sodium Gluconate;Good;Chelating Agent, Humectant;Hydration;In addition to being a chelating agent, sodium gluconate in skin care can also function as a humectant, meaning it helps skin retain a balanced amount of water. Its typical use level in cosmetics is 0.1-1.0%.
Sodium Hexametaphosphate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer;;Salt with multiple functions in cosmetics. It can act as a detergent, an emulsifier, a texturizer, and a preservative that prevents metallic compounds from negatively affecting a product.
Sodium Hyaluronate;Best;Humectant, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging, Soothing;The chief difference between hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate is that sodium hyaluronate is more bioavailable - meaning skin more readily absorbs it than hyaluronic acid. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better than hyaluronic acid, merely that many skin care products contain both forms, so your skin sees maximum benefits. Both hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate are available in different molecular weights for multi-level results (lower molecular weight can penetrate deeper into skin’s layers, where higher weights deliver immediate results on the surface).
Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer;Best;Humectant, Antioxidant, Polymer;Hydration, Anti-Aging, Soothing;A modified form of skin-replenishing hyaluronic acid attached to a polymer structure that keeps it within skin's uppermost layers longer, allowing for enhanced hydration. Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer is not animal-derived.
Sodium Hydroxide;Average;pH Adjuster/Stabilizer;;Sodium hydroxide is seen in many applications in beauty products, such as nail cuticle solvents and hair straighteners, where it’s used in greater amounts (between 2% and 5% concentrations by weight) than in leave-on skin care products or makeup (for example, some lipsticks contain 0.25% sodium hydroxide). It’s also used as a cleansing and denaturing agent. It’s a significant skin sensitizer in concentrations of 10% or greater.
Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate;Average;Humectant, Preservative;Hydration;"Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate is an amino acid derivative used as a skin-softening agent; can also function as a preservative in skin care products."

Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate;Good;Texture Enhancer, Emulsifier;;Sodium lauroyl lactylate is a naturally derived ingredient that is used as an emulsifier and mild thickening agent in cosmetics. In higher concentrations, it functions as a surfactant.
Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids;Best;Humectant, Cleansing Agent;Hydration;A salt created by condensing the chloride form of lauric acid (a fatty acid) with amino acids derived from oat protein. It functions as skin-softening and soothing ingredient and has cleansing properties. Sodium lauroyl oat amino acids may be natural or synthetic. It's considered very gentle and unlikely to cause skin dryness or irritation.
Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;Safety assessments have confirmed that this ingredient is non-irritating and non-sensitizing when applied to human skin in amounts up to 15% in rinse-off and 5% in leave-on products. It is approved for use in cosmetics.
Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate;Good;Cleansing Agent;;Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate is a gentle cleansing agent that may be derived from coconut or made synthetically. Often used to improve the sensorial effects.
Sodium Lauryl Sulfate;Worst;Cleansing Agent, Irritant;;Versatile ingredient composed of several non-volatile alcohols. Functions primarily as a surfactant, but can also be used as a skin-conditioning agent, emulsifier, and solvent. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is one of the most sensitizing cleansing agents used in skincare products. In fact, it's considered a standard comparison substance for measuring the skin sensitization of other ingredients. In fact, in scientific studies, when the researchers want to establish whether or not an ingredient is problematic for skin, they compare its effect to that of SLS.In amounts of 2% to 5%, sodium lauryl sulfate can cause sensitizing reactions for many people. Despite the sensitivity issue, it is not the same as the dire and erroneous warnings floating around the web about this ingredient, all of which have been debunked. Sodium lauryl sulfate isn't a great ingredient in terms of its impact on skin, but its effects are not detrimental to one's health.
Sodium Levulinate;Good;Humectant;Hydration;Sodium levulinate is the salt of levulinic acid, a synthetic organic acid that helps condition and soften skin. Sodium levulinate is sometimes part of preservative blend because it exhibits antimicrobial action, although this is more common in food than for cosmetics. The levulinic acid component can be transformed by naturally-occuring microbes into other helpful substances, including the moisturizing ingredient trehalose.
Sodium Metabisulfite;Average;Preservative, Antioxidant, Irritant;;Reducing agent that alters the structure of hair. It can also be used as a preservative in formulations, and can be a skin sensitizer. However, it can also be an antioxidant.

Sodium Polyacrylate Starch;Good;Absorbent, Texture Enhancer;Oil Control;"A mixture of a natural starch combined with a synthetic acrylate polymer. As with most starches, it works in cosmetics as a texture enhancer, thickening agent, stabilizer, and absorbent, the latter benefit occurring when higher amounts are used. Sodium polyacrylate starch is considered safe as used in cosmetics; it size does not allow penetration past skin's surface."
Sodium Salicylate;Average;Preservative;;Salt form of salicylic acid (BHA). Because it is not the acid form of salicylate (i.e., salicylic acid), it does not have exfoliating properties.
Sodium Silicate;Worst;pH Adjuster/Stabilizer, Irritant;;Highly alkaline and potentially sensitizing mineral used in cosmetics.
Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate;Good;Cleansing Agent;Hydration;Chemically, sodium stearoyl glutamate belongs to the amino acid group since the glutamate portion (not to be confused with the protein gluten) comes from the amino acid known as glutamic acid, which enhances skin hydration. The sodium portion makes it an amino acid salt, and it as well as similar ingredients in this amino acid group are considered non-irritating.
Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate;Good;Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer;;A synthetic or animal-derived ingredient (Paula’s Choice Skincare uses the former) that stabilizes the water phase of moisturizers and other skincare products that contain hydrating ingredients. Sodium stearoyl lactylate works via its interaction with proteins and starches, where it can also help modify a product’s texture. It can also function as a surfactant.

Soothing Agent;Best;Antioxidant, Humectant, Emollient;Soothing, Anti-Aging;Any ingredient that soothes and improves signs of sensitivity. Interestingly, most antioxidants function as soothing ingredients because one of the skin’s responses to environmental damage is sensitivity, visible signs of stress on skin’s surface, and redness. These ingredients go a long way toward helping the skin deal with its daily struggle against environmental damage and seasonal environmental extremes.
Sorbeth-230 Tetraoleate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Texture Enhancer, Emulsifier;;Sorbeth-230 tetraoleate is a mixture of the fatty acid oleic acid with derivatives of the sugar ingredient sorbitol and other substances to create a synthetic ingredient that cleanses, emulsifies, and can help thicken cosmetic formulas. Sorbeth-230 is among the newer cleansing agents created in response to the sulfate-free push, and it’s a welcome addition due to its mildness and generally non-irritating nature (at least according to the claims made by the company selling this ingredient).
Sorbic Acid;Good;Preservative;;Sorbic acid is a preservative naturally derived from mountain ash berries or manufactured synthetically. Used in many products, including several foods, cosmetics and even in contact lens solutions.
Sorbitan Isostearate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;Amounts as low as 2% can be used to stabilize emulsions, and its safety has been established in concentrations up to 25%, although sorbitan isostearate is rarely used above 10% concentration in skin care formulas.
Sorbitan Laurate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;"An ester of lauric acid and portions of the sugar ingredient sorbitol. This ingredient works as a cleansing agent and emulsifier, and may be naturally-derived or synthetic. Amounts above 5% are likely to cause skin irritation; however, sorbitan laurate is typically used in lower amounts, along with other cleansing agents. As such, it’s considered a safe ingredient for use on skin."
Sorbitan Oleate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;Sorbitan oleate is a synthetic or animal-derived ingredient used as an emulsifier and cleansing agent in cosmetics. Considered safe as used in cosmetics.
Sorbitan Olivate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;A mixture of the fatty acids from olive oil plus a dehydrated sugar known as sorbitol.

Sucrose Stearate;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emollient;Hydration;The ester of stearic acid and sucrose (sugar), sucrose stearate works in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier, and cleansing agent. It can be animal-, plant-derived or synthetic, with the plant-derived version being most common. Sucrose stearate is considered safe as used in cosmetics and has been shown to help enhance the effectiveness of other ingredients.
Sugarcane Extract;Average;Plant Extracts, Humectant;Hydration;Ingredients like sugarcane extract, fruit extracts, mixed fruit extracts, and milk solids may claim an association with AHAs, but they are not the same thing nor do they have the same beneficial effect on skin. While glycolic acid can indeed be derived from sugarcane, if you assume that sugarcane will net you the same result as glycolic acid, that would be like assuming you could write on a tree the way you can write on paper. Wood is certainly where paper begins, but paper wouldn’t exist if the wood didn’t undergo complex mechanical and chemical processes. Similarly, the original forms of these extracts do not have the same effect as the ingredients that are derived from them. The same is true for lactic acid, derived from milk. There is a vast difference between the extracted, pure ingredient and the original form of the source material.
Sulfates;Good;Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier;;"“Sulfates can be sensitizing.” This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that’s NOT because it’s a sulfate; rather, it’s because of its interaction with skin."
Sulfur;Worst;Irritant;Anti-Acne;Can be a potent skin sensitizer. Sulfur also has a high pH, which can encourage the growth of bacteria on skin. Sulfur has more negatives than positives for skin, and its use to treat skin concerns should be seen as a last resort if other ingredients (such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and salicylic acid) don’t work as well as you had hoped.
Sunflower Seed Oil;Best;Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;"Sunflower seed oil is a non-volatile, non-fragrant plant oil used as an emollient in cosmetics. Sunflower seed oil’s 60% (on average) linoleic acid content has the ability to help replenish, strengthen, and soothe skin. This oil also contains other beneficial fatty acids skin can use, including oleic, palmitic, stearic, and a small amount of omega-3 linolenic acid.
Sunflower oil is particularly beneficial for dry, dehydrated, or environmentally compromised skin because its linoleic acid content helps skin synthesize its own lipids (fats), including ceramides, visibly repairing its barrier and leading to smoother, healthier-looking skin.
Sunflower seed oil also has a natural calming effect on skin, so can be helpful for reducing signs of skin stress or irritation. In fact, research on infants with atopic dermatitis has shown that topical sunflower oil is a viable ingredient to alternate with topical steroids normally prescribed to control symptoms of this skin disorder."
Sun Protection Factor;Best;UV Filters;Anti-Aging;"Most commonly seen as SPF followed by a number, it is a rating system assigned to a product that identifies the amount of time it can protect the skin from sunburn or from turning pink or red when exposed to sun. In the United States, SPF ratings are regulated by the Fod & Drug Administration. Because sunburn results from UVB radiation, not UVA radiation, SPF is primarily a measure of UVB protection; however, sunscreens rated for broad spectrum protection can protect from UVA rays, too."

Tea Tree Oil;Average;Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant;Anti-Acne;"Also known as Melaleuca, from the name of its native Australian plant source, Melaleuca alternifolia. Tea tree oil has skin-soothing properties and is also an antioxidant. However, as with most fragrant plant oils, tea tree oil contains volatile components (such as linalool, limonene, and eucalyptol) that can be sensitizing, particularly if you apply 100% pure tea tree oil.For improving skin concerns such as breakouts, tea tree oil concentrations of 2.5% to 10% are recommended. However, the amount present in most skincare products is usually less than 1%, as higher amounts impart a strong scent many people find intolerable, not to mention these higher amounts increase tea tree oil’s potential to sensitize and redden skin.Careful use and storage of tea tree oil is advised; like all plant oils, it should be protected from routine exposure to light and air. Tea tree oil’s potential to sensitize skin increases when it is exposed to air because the oxidation makes the volatile components more potent."

Undaria Pinnatifida (Algae) Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts, Texture Enhancer;Anti-Aging, Soothing;"Undaria pinnatifida, also known as brown algae, is a type of seaweed that’s also edible. As with most seaweeds, it’s a rich source of nutrients, and those benefit skin when applied topically. Among the benefits from applying brown algae to skin are antioxidant from its polyphenols, hydration from its polysaccharides, and soothing, thanks to a compound known as fucoidan.
In vitro (test tube) research has shown this type of algae plays a disruptive role in the pathway melanin (skin pigment) takes to make it to skin’s surface. In theory, topical use may keep discolorations at bay.
Some research indicates brown algae has more antioxidants than red or green algae, but topically, all of them can thwart the cascade of damage common airborne pollutants can trigger on skin."

UVA;Worst;UV Filters;Anti-Aging;"Ultraviolet A radiation. The sun produces a range of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, of which UVA and UVB affect our skin. UVA rays have wavelengths of 320 to 400 nanometers; UVB rays have wavelengths of 290 to 320 nanometers. UVB radiation causes sunburn, while UVA radiation does not produce any visible short-term evidence of skin damage. Nonetheless, UVA radiation creates serious cumulative changes in skin that may be far greater than the sunburn caused by UVB radiation. Research has shown that unprotected exposure to UVA rays can, within one week, create distinct injury. Research also indicates UVA exposure is even more damaging than we once knew: it seems that when UVA radiation hits skin, it not only penetrates to skin's lower layers but the damage ""bounces back"" like light reflecting from a mirror, giving every layer of your skin a double-whammy of damage. UVA radiation prompts tanning, yes, but the tan you see is direct evidence of your skin responding, as best it can, to the onslaught of damage it just endured.To be truly effective and beneficial for skin, sunscreens must protect skin from both the sun's UVA and UVB radiation. In the United States, there are four ingredients approved by the FDA that protect across the full UVA range: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone (also called Parsol 1789 and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane)."

Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing;"Bilberry is one of the best sources of antioxidant compounds known as anthocyanins, polyphenolic chemicals that give bilberries their dark color. Not surprisingly, bilberries are similar to blueberries.
Applied to skin, bilberry is known to strengthen skin against signs of redness, likely due to its calming properties. Bilberry can also boost skin’s environmental defenses in the presence of UVA light.
Note that while bilberry contains antioxidants known as tannins, the amounts are low and unlikely to pose a risk to skin. Tannins are one of the antioxidant chemicals in some plants (the most well-known being witch hazel) that offer benefits and risks for skin when they comprise a larger portion of a plant’s antioxidants."
Vaccinium Vitis-Idaea (Lingonberry) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing;Taste-wise, lingonberry is sometimes compared with cranberry, with the latter having a stronger tart flavor while lingonberries are sweeter.
Vaccinum Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract;Best;Antioxidant, Plant Extracts;Anti-Aging, Soothing;"Research has shown that the antioxidants in blueberries are particularly adept at shielding skin from the unwanted changes in skin that occur when it’s exposed to visible and infrared light. Essentially, the blueberries work to intercept damage before it takes hold, leading to healthier-looking skin. Just to be clear, though, blueberries do not replace a broad-spectrum sunscreen; rather, their benefits complement what sunscreen does to protect skin."
Valine;Good;Antioxidant, Humectant;Hydration, Anti-Aging;
