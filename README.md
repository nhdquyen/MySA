# MySA - My Skincare Assistant

MySA is my final project for Data Science Bootcampt at CoderSchool. It is an end-to-end solution deployed on Streamlit that takes input of skincare's front label photo and returns explanation for each ingredient used in the product. It features OCR transfered learning, web scraping data extraction and string match metric.
